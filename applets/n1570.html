<h3>ABSTRACT. [Abstract]</h3>
<pre>(Cover sheet to be provided by ISO Secretariat.)

This International Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of
programs expressed in the programming language C. Its purpose is to promote
portability, reliability, maintainability, and efficient execution of C language programs on
a variety of computing systems.

Clauses are included that detail the C language itself and the contents of the C language
execution library. Annexes summarize aspects of both of them, and enumerate factors
that influence the portability of C programs.

Although this International Standard is intended to guide knowledgeable C language
programmers as well as implementors of C language translation systems, the document
itself is not designed to serve as a tutorial.

Recipients of this draft are invited to submit, with their comments, notification of any
relevant patent rights of which they are aware and to provide supporting documentation.

Changes from the previous draft (N1539) are indicated by &lsquo;&lsquo;diff marks&rsquo;&rsquo; in the right
margin: deleted text is marked with &lsquo;&lsquo;&lowast;&rsquo;&rsquo;, new or changed text with &lsquo;&lsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;.

<h3>FOREWORD. [Foreword]</h3>
<a name='FOREWORD.p1'></a>
<pre>1   ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International
    Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide
    standardization. National bodies that are member of ISO or IEC participate in the
    development of International Standards through technical committees established by the
    respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
    technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
    organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also
    take part in the work.
</pre>
<a name='FOREWORD.p2'></a>
<pre>2   International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 2. This International Standard was drafted in accordance with the fifth
    edition (2004).
</pre>
<a name='FOREWORD.p3'></a>
<pre>3   In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical
    committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical
    committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International
    Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the national bodies casting a vote.
</pre>
<a name='FOREWORD.p4'></a>
<pre>4   Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be
    the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any
    or all such patent rights.
</pre>
<a name='FOREWORD.p5'></a>
<pre>5   This International Standard was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1,
    Information technology, Subcommittee SC 22, Programming languages, their
    environments and system software interfaces. The Working Group responsible for this
    standard (WG 14) maintains a site on the World Wide Web at http://www.open-
    std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/ containing additional information relevant to this
    standard such as a Rationale for many of the decisions made during its preparation and a
    log of Defect Reports and Responses.
</pre>
<a name='FOREWORD.p6'></a>

<h3>INTRO. [Introduction]</h3>
<a name='INTRO.p1'></a>
<pre>1   With the introduction of new devices and extended character sets, new features may be
    added to this International Standard. Subclauses in the language and library clauses warn
    implementors and programmers of usages which, though valid in themselves, may
    conflict with future additions.
</pre>
<a name='INTRO.p2'></a>
<pre>2   Certain features are obsolescent, which means that they may be considered for
    withdrawal in future revisions of this International Standard. They are retained because
    of their widespread use, but their use in new implementations (for implementation
    features) or new programs (for language [<a href='#6.11'>6.11</a>] or library features [<a href='#7.31'>7.31</a>]) is discouraged.
</pre>
<a name='INTRO.p3'></a>
<pre>3   This International Standard is divided into four major subdivisions:
    &mdash; preliminary elements (clauses 1&minus;4);
    &mdash; the characteristics of environments that translate and execute C programs (clause 5);
    &mdash; the language syntax, constraints, and semantics (clause 6);
    &mdash; the library facilities (clause 7).
</pre>
<a name='INTRO.p4'></a>
<pre>4   Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the constructions described.
    Footnotes are provided to emphasize consequences of the rules described in that
    subclause or elsewhere in this International Standard. References are used to refer to
    other related subclauses. Recommendations are provided to give advice or guidance to
    implementors. Annexes provide additional information and summarize the information
    contained in this International Standard. A bibliography lists documents that were
    referred to during the preparation of the standard.
</pre>
<a name='INTRO.p5'></a>
<pre>5   The language clause (clause 6) is derived from &lsquo;&lsquo;The C Reference Manual&rsquo;&rsquo;.
</pre>
<a name='INTRO.p6'></a>
<pre>6   The library clause (clause 7) is based on the 1984 /usr/group Standard.

<h3>1. [Scope]</h3>
<a name='1.p1'></a>
<pre>1   This International Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of
    programs written in the C programming language.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.1'><sup>[1]</sup></a> It specifies
    &mdash; the representation of C programs;
    &mdash; the syntax and constraints of the C language;
    &mdash; the semantic rules for interpreting C programs;
    &mdash; the representation of input data to be processed by C programs;
    &mdash; the representation of output data produced by C programs;
    &mdash; the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.1'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 1)</b> This International Standard is designed to promote the portability of C programs among a variety of
         data-processing systems. It is intended for use by implementors and programmers.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='1.p2'></a>
<pre>2   This International Standard does not specify
    &mdash; the mechanism by which C programs are transformed for use by a data-processing
      system;
    &mdash; the mechanism by which C programs are invoked for use by a data-processing
      system;
    &mdash; the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C program;
    &mdash; the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C
      program;
    &mdash; the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any
      specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;
    &mdash; all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a
      conforming implementation.

<h3>5.1.1.1 [Program structure]</h3>
<a name='5.1.1.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   A C program need not all be translated at the same time. The text of the program is kept
    in units called source files, (or preprocessing files) in this International Standard. A
    source file together with all the headers and source files included via the preprocessing
    directive #include is known as a preprocessing translation unit. After preprocessing, a
    preprocessing translation unit is called a translation unit. Previously translated translation
    units may be preserved individually or in libraries. The separate translation units of a
    program communicate by (for example) calls to functions whose identifiers have external
    linkage, manipulation of objects whose identifiers have external linkage, or manipulation
    of data files. Translation units may be separately translated and then later linked to
    produce an executable program.

<h3>5.1.1.2 [Translation phases]</h3>
<a name='5.1.1.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following
    phases.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.6'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
         1.   Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an implementation-
              defined manner, to the source character set (introducing new-line characters for
              end-of-line indicators) if necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by
              corresponding single-character internal representations.
     2.   Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line
          character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines.
          Only the last backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
          of such a splice. A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
          which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such
          splicing takes place.
     3.   The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens<a href='#FOOTNOTE.7'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and sequences of
          white-space characters (including comments). A source file shall not end in a
          partial preprocessing token or in a partial comment. Each comment is replaced by
          one space character. New-line characters are retained. Whether each nonempty
          sequence of white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced by
          one space character is implementation-defined.
     4. Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and
        _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. If a character sequence that
        matches the syntax of a universal character name is produced by token
        concatenation (<a href='#6.10.3.3'>6.10.3.3</a>), the behavior is undefined. A #include preprocessing
        directive causes the named header or source file to be processed from phase 1
        through phase 4, recursively. All preprocessing directives are then deleted.
     5. Each source character set member and escape sequence in character constants and
        string literals is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character
        set; if there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an implementation-
        defined member other than the null (wide) character.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.8'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
     6.   Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
     7. White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each
        preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens are
        syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.

<pre>4   In the abstract machine, all expressions are evaluated as specified by the semantics. An

<a name='5.1.2.3p6'></a>
<pre>6    The least requirements on a conforming implementation are:
     &mdash; Accesses to volatile objects are evaluated strictly according to the rules of the abstract

     &mdash; At program termination, all data written into files shall be identical to the result that
       execution of the program according to the abstract semantics would have produced.
     &mdash; The input and output dynamics of interactive devices shall take place as specified in
       <a href='#7.21.3'>7.21.3</a>. The intent of these requirements is that unbuffered or line-buffered output
       appear as soon as possible, to ensure that prompting messages actually appear prior to
       a program waiting for input.
     This is the observable behavior of the program.

<pre>7    What constitutes an interactive device is implementation-defined.

<a name='5.1.2.3p9'></a>
<pre>9    EXAMPLE 1 An implementation might define a one-to-one correspondence between abstract and actual

     abstract semantics. The keyword volatile would then be redundant.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.3p10'></a>
<pre>10   Alternatively, an implementation might perform various optimizations within each translation unit, such
     that the actual semantics would agree with the abstract semantics only when making function calls across
     translation unit boundaries. In such an implementation, at the time of each function entry and function
     return where the calling function and the called function are in different translation units, the values of all
     externally linked objects and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract
     semantics. Furthermore, at the time of each such function entry the values of the parameters of the called
     function and of all objects accessible via pointers therein would agree with the abstract semantics. In this
     type of implementation, objects referred to by interrupt service routines activated by the signal function
     would require explicit specification of volatile storage, as well as other implementation-defined
     restrictions.

              /* ... */
              c1 = c1 + c2;
     the &lsquo;&lsquo;integer promotions&rsquo;&rsquo; require that the abstract machine promote the value of each variable to int size
     and then add the two ints and truncate the sum. Provided the addition of two chars can be done without
     overflow, or with overflow wrapping silently to produce the correct result, the actual execution need only
     produce the same result, possibly omitting the promotions.

              /* ... */
              f1 = f2 * d;
     the multiplication may be executed using single-precision arithmetic if the implementation can ascertain
     that the result would be the same as if it were executed using double-precision arithmetic (for example, if d
     were replaced by the constant 2.0, which has type double).

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.3p13'></a>
<pre>13   EXAMPLE 4 Implementations employing wide registers have to take care to honor appropriate
     semantics. Values are independent of whether they are represented in a register or in memory. For
     example, an implicit spilling of a register is not permitted to alter the value. Also, an explicit store and load
     is required to round to the precision of the storage type. In particular, casts and assignments are required to
     perform their specified conversion. For the fragment
              double d1, d2;
              float f;
              d1 = f = expression;

     the values assigned to d1 and d2 are required to have been converted to float.

<a name='5.1.2.3p14'></a>
<pre>14   EXAMPLE 5 Rearrangement for floating-point expressions is often restricted because of limitations in
     precision as well as range. The implementation cannot generally apply the mathematical associative rules
     for addition or multiplication, nor the distributive rule, because of roundoff error, even in the absence of
     overflow and underflow. Likewise, implementations cannot generally replace decimal constants in order to
     rearrange expressions. In the following fragment, rearrangements suggested by mathematical rules for real
     numbers are often not valid (see <a href='#F.9'>F.9</a>).
              double x, y, z;

              z = x + x * y;    // not equivalent to z = x * (1.0 + y);

<pre>15   EXAMPLE 6       To illustrate the grouping behavior of expressions, in the following fragment
              int a, b;
              /* ... */
              a = a + 32760 + b + 5;
     the expression statement behaves exactly the same as
              a = (((a + 32760) + b) + 5);
     due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the result of the sum (a + 32760) is
     next added to b, and that result is then added to 5 which results in the value assigned to a. On a machine in
     which overflows produce an explicit trap and in which the range of values representable by an int is
     [&minus;32768, +32767], the implementation cannot rewrite this expression as
              a = ((a + b) + 32765);
     since if the values for a and b were, respectively, &minus;32754 and &minus;15, the sum a + b would produce a trap
     while the original expression would not; nor can the expression be rewritten either as
              a = ((a + 32765) + b);
     or
              a = (a + (b + 32765));
     since the values for a and b might have been, respectively, 4 and &minus;8 or &minus;17 and 12. However, on a machine
     in which overflow silently generates some value and where positive and negative overflows cancel, the
     above expression statement can be rewritten by the implementation in any of the above ways because the
     same result will occur.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.3p16'></a>
<pre>16   EXAMPLE 7 The grouping of an expression does not completely determine its evaluation. In the

              char *p;
              /* ... */
              sum = sum * 10 - &#39;0&#39; + (*p++ = getchar());
     the expression statement is grouped as if it were written as
              sum = (((sum * 10) - &#39;0&#39;) + ((*(p++)) = (getchar())));
     but the actual increment of p can occur at any time between the previous sequence point and the next
     sequence point (the ;), and the call to getchar can occur at any point prior to the need of its returned
     value.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p5'></a>
<pre>5    The library defines a number of atomic operations (<a href='#7.17'>7.17</a>) and operations on mutexes
     (<a href='#7.26.4'>7.26.4</a>) that are specially identified as synchronization operations. These operations play
     a special role in making assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization
     operation on one or more memory locations is either an acquire operation, a release
     operation, both an acquire and release operation, or a consume operation. A
     synchronization operation without an associated memory location is a fence and can be
     either an acquire fence, a release fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In addition,
     there are relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization operations, and
     atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special characteristics.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p6'></a>
<pre>6    NOTE 2 For example, a call that acquires a mutex will perform an acquire operation on the locations
     composing the mutex. Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a release
     operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a release operation on A forces prior side effects
     on other memory locations to become visible to other threads that later perform an acquire or consume
     operation on A. We do not include relaxed atomic operations as synchronization operations although, like
     synchronization operations, they cannot contribute to data races.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p7'></a>
<pre>7    All modifications to a particular atomic object M occur in some particular total order,

     defined below.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p8'></a>

<pre>9    NOTE 4 There is a separate order for each atomic object. There is no requirement that these can be

     may observe modifications to different variables in inconsistent orders.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p10'></a>
<pre>10   A release sequence headed by a release operation A on an atomic object M is a maximal
     contiguous sub-sequence of side effects in the modification order of M, where the first
     operation is A and every subsequent operation either is performed by the same thread that
     performed the release or is an atomic read-modify-write operation.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p11'></a>
<pre>11   Certain library calls synchronize with other library calls performed by another thread. In
     particular, an atomic operation A that performs a release operation on an object M
     synchronizes with an atomic operation B that performs an acquire operation on M and
     reads a value written by any side effect in the release sequence headed by A.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p12'></a>
<pre>12   NOTE 5 Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does not necessarily ensure visibility as

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p13'></a>
<pre>13   NOTE 6 The specifications of the synchronization operations define when one reads the value written by
     another. For atomic variables, the definition is clear. All operations on a given mutex occur in a single total
     order. Each mutex acquisition &lsquo;&lsquo;reads the value written&rsquo;&rsquo; by the last mutex release.

<pre>17   NOTE 7 The &lsquo;&lsquo;inter-thread happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; relation describes arbitrary concatenations of &lsquo;&lsquo;sequenced
     before&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;synchronizes with&rsquo;&rsquo;, and &lsquo;&lsquo;dependency-ordered before&rsquo;&rsquo; relationships, with two exceptions. The
     first exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with &lsquo;&lsquo;dependency-ordered before&rsquo;&rsquo; followed
     by &lsquo;&lsquo;sequenced before&rsquo;&rsquo;. The reason for this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
     &lsquo;&lsquo;dependency-ordered before&rsquo;&rsquo; relationship provides ordering only with respect to operations to which this
     consume operation actually carries a dependency. The reason that this limitation applies only to the end of
     such a concatenation is that any subsequent release operation will provide the required ordering for a prior
     consume operation. The second exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to consist entirely of
     &lsquo;&lsquo;sequenced before&rsquo;&rsquo;. The reasons for this limitation are (1) to permit &lsquo;&lsquo;inter-thread happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; to be
     transitively closed and (2) the &lsquo;&lsquo;happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; relation, defined below, provides for relationships
     consisting entirely of &lsquo;&lsquo;sequenced before&rsquo;&rsquo;.

<a name='5.1.2.4p19'></a>
<pre>19   A visible side effect A on an object M with respect to a value computation B of M
     satisfies the conditions:
     &mdash; A happens before B, and
     &mdash; there is no other side effect X to M such that A happens before X and X happens
         before B.
     The value of a non-atomic scalar object M, as determined by evaluation B, shall be the
     value stored by the visible side effect A.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p20'></a>
<pre>20   NOTE 8 If there is ambiguity about which side effect to a non-atomic object is visible, then there is a data
     race and the behavior is undefined.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p21'></a>
<pre>21   NOTE 9 This states that operations on ordinary variables are not visibly reordered. This is not actually
     detectable without data races, but it is necessary to ensure that data races, as defined here, and with suitable
     restrictions on the use of atomics, correspond to data races in a simple interleaved (sequentially consistent)
     execution.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p22'></a>
<pre>22   The visible sequence of side effects on an atomic object M, with respect to a value
     computation B of M, is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side effects in the
     modification order of M, where the first side effect is visible with respect to B, and for
     every subsequent side effect, it is not the case that B happens before it. The value of an
     atomic object M, as determined by evaluation B, shall be the value stored by some
     operation in the visible sequence of M with respect to B. Furthermore, if a value
     computation A of an atomic object M happens before a value computation B of M, and
     the value computed by A corresponds to the value stored by side effect X, then the value
     computed by B shall either equal the value computed by A, or be the value stored by side
     effect Y , where Y follows X in the modification order of M.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p23'></a>
<pre>23   NOTE 10 This effectively disallows compiler reordering of atomic operations to a single object, even if
     both operations are &lsquo;&lsquo;relaxed&rsquo;&rsquo; loads. By doing so, we effectively make the &lsquo;&lsquo;cache coherence&rsquo;&rsquo; guarantee
     provided by most hardware available to C atomic operations.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p24'></a>
<pre>24   NOTE 11 The visible sequence depends on the &lsquo;&lsquo;happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; relation, which in turn depends on the
     values observed by loads of atomics, which we are restricting here. The intended reading is that there must
     exist an association of atomic loads with modifications they observe that, together with suitably chosen
     modification orders and the &lsquo;&lsquo;happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; relation derived as described above, satisfy the resulting
     constraints as imposed here.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p25'></a>
<pre>25   The execution of a program contains a data race if it contains two conflicting actions in
     different threads, at least one of which is not atomic, and neither happens before the
     other. Any such data race results in undefined behavior.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p26'></a>
<pre>26   NOTE 12 It can be shown that programs that correctly use simple mutexes and
     memory_order_seq_cst operations to prevent all data races, and use no other synchronization
     operations, behave as though the operations executed by their constituent threads were simply interleaved,
     with each value computation of an object being the last value stored in that interleaving. This is normally
     referred to as &lsquo;&lsquo;sequential consistency&rsquo;&rsquo;. However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and data-
     race-free programs cannot observe most program transformations that do not change single-threaded
     program semantics. In fact, most single-threaded program transformations continue to be allowed, since
     any program that behaves differently as a result must contain undefined behavior.
</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p27'></a>
<pre>27   NOTE 13 Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a potentially shared memory location
     that would not be modified by the abstract machine are generally precluded by this standard, since such an
     assignment might overwrite another assignment by a different thread in cases in which an abstract machine
     execution would not have encountered a data race. This includes implementations of data member
     assignment that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory locations. We also generally preclude
     reordering of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question may alias, since this may violate the
     &quot;visible sequence&quot; rules.

</pre>
<a name='5.1.2.4p28'></a>
<pre>28   NOTE 14 Transformations that introduce a speculative read of a potentially shared memory location may
     not preserve the semantics of the program as defined in this standard, since they potentially introduce a data
     race. However, they are typically valid in the context of an optimizing compiler that targets a specific
     machine with well-defined semantics for data races. They would be invalid for a hypothetical machine that
     is not tolerant of races or provides hardware race detection.

<h3>5.2.1 [Character sets]</h3>
<a name='5.2.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   Two sets of characters and their associated collating sequences shall be defined: the set in
    which source files are written (the source character set), and the set interpreted in the
    execution environment (the execution character set). Each set is further divided into a
    basic character set, whose contents are given by this subclause, and a set of zero or more
    locale-specific members (which are not members of the basic character set) called
    extended characters. The combined set is also called the extended character set. The
    values of the members of the execution character set are implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='5.2.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   In a character constant or string literal, members of the execution character set shall be
    represented by corresponding members of the source character set or by escape
    sequences consisting of the backslash \ followed by one or more characters. A byte with
    all bits set to 0, called the null character, shall exist in the basic execution character set; it
    is used to terminate a character string.
</pre>
<a name='5.2.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   Both the basic source and basic execution character sets shall have the following
    members: the 26 uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet

    the space character, and control characters representing horizontal tab, vertical tab, and
    form feed. The representation of each member of the source and execution basic
    character sets shall fit in a byte. In both the source and execution basic character sets, the
    value of each character after 0 in the above list of decimal digits shall be one greater than
    the value of the previous. In source files, there shall be some way of indicating the end of
    each line of text; this International Standard treats such an end-of-line indicator as if it
    were a single new-line character. In the basic execution character set, there shall be
    control characters representing alert, backspace, carriage return, and new line. If any
    other characters are encountered in a source file (except in an identifier, a character
    constant, a string literal, a header name, a comment, or a preprocessing token that is never
    converted to a token), the behavior is undefined.

<h3>5.2.1.2 [Multibyte characters]</h3>
<a name='5.2.1.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The source character set may contain multibyte characters, used to represent members of
    the extended character set. The execution character set may also contain multibyte
    characters, which need not have the same encoding as for the source character set. For
    both character sets, the following shall hold:
    &mdash; The basic character set shall be present and each character shall be encoded as a
      single byte.
    &mdash; The presence, meaning, and representation of any additional members is locale-
      specific.
    &mdash; A multibyte character set may have a state-dependent encoding, wherein each
      sequence of multibyte characters begins in an initial shift state and enters other
      locale-specific shift states when specific multibyte characters are encountered in the
      sequence. While in the initial shift state, all single-byte characters retain their usual
      interpretation and do not alter the shift state. The interpretation for subsequent bytes
      in the sequence is a function of the current shift state.
    &mdash; A byte with all bits zero shall be interpreted as a null character independent of shift
      state. Such a byte shall not occur as part of any other multibyte character.

<h3>5.2.2 [Character display semantics]</h3>
<a name='5.2.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The active position is that location on a display device where the next character output by
    the fputc function would appear. The intent of writing a printing character (as defined
    by the isprint function) to a display device is to display a graphic representation of
    that character at the active position and then advance the active position to the next
    position on the current line. The direction of writing is locale-specific. If the active
    position is at the final position of a line (if there is one), the behavior of the display device
    is unspecified.
</pre>
<a name='5.2.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   Alphabetic escape sequences representing nongraphic characters in the execution
    character set are intended to produce actions on display devices as follows:
    \a (alert) Produces an audible or visible alert without changing the active position.
    \b (backspace) Moves the active position to the previous position on the current line. If
       the active position is at the initial position of a line, the behavior of the display
       device is unspecified.
    \f ( form feed) Moves the active position to the initial position at the start of the next
       logical page.
    \n (new line) Moves the active position to the initial position of the next line.
    \r (carriage return) Moves the active position to the initial position of the current line.
    \t (horizontal tab) Moves the active position to the next horizontal tabulation position
       on the current line. If the active position is at or past the last defined horizontal
       tabulation position, the behavior of the display device is unspecified.
    \v (vertical tab) Moves the active position to the initial position of the next vertical
       tabulation position. If the active position is at or past the last defined vertical
         tabulation position, the behavior of the display device is unspecified.
</pre>
<a name='5.2.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   Each of these escape sequences shall produce a unique implementation-defined value

<h3>5.2.4.2.2 [Characteristics of floating types &lt;float.h&gt;]</h3>
<a name='5.2.4.2.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The characteristics of floating types are defined in terms of a model that describes a
    representation of floating-point numbers and values that provide information about an
    implementation&rsquo;s floating-point arithmetic.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.21'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The following parameters are used to
    define the model for each floating-point type:
           s         sign (&plusmn;1)
           b         base or radix of exponent representation (an integer &gt; 1)
           e         exponent (an integer between a minimum emin and a maximum emax )
           p         precision (the number of base-b digits in the significand)
            fk       nonnegative integers less than b (the significand digits)
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.21'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 21)</b> The floating-point model is intended to clarify the description of each floating-point characteristic and
        does not require the floating-point arithmetic of the implementation to be identical.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='5.2.4.2.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   A floating-point number (x) is defined by the following model:
                      p
           x = sb e &Sigma; f k b&minus;k ,    emin &le; e &le; emax
                     k=1

</pre>
<a name='5.2.4.2.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   In addition to normalized floating-point numbers ( f 1 &gt; 0 if x &ne; 0), floating types may be
    able to contain other kinds of floating-point numbers, such as subnormal floating-point
    numbers (x &ne; 0, e = emin , f 1 = 0) and unnormalized floating-point numbers (x &ne; 0,
    e &gt; emin , f 1 = 0), and values that are not floating-point numbers, such as infinities and
    NaNs. A NaN is an encoding signifying Not-a-Number. A quiet NaN propagates
    through almost every arithmetic operation without raising a floating-point exception; a
    signaling NaN generally raises a floating-point exception when occurring as an
    arithmetic operand.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.22'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.22'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 22)</b> IEC 60559:1989 specifies quiet and signaling NaNs. For implementations that do not support
        IEC 60559:1989, the terms quiet NaN and signaling NaN are intended to apply to encodings with
        similar behavior.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='5.2.4.2.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   An implementation may give zero and values that are not floating-point numbers (such as
    infinities and NaNs) a sign or may leave them unsigned. Wherever such values are
    unsigned, any requirement in this International Standard to retrieve the sign shall produce
    an unspecified sign, and any requirement to set the sign shall be ignored.
</pre>
<a name='5.2.4.2.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   The minimum range of representable values for a floating type is the most negative finite
    floating-point number representable in that type through the most positive finite floating-
    point number representable in that type. In addition, if negative infinity is representable
    in a type, the range of that type is extended to all negative real numbers; likewise, if
    positive infinity is representable in a type, the range of that type is extended to all positive
    real numbers.

    &lt;math.h&gt; and &lt;complex.h&gt; that return floating-point results is implementation-
    defined, as is the accuracy of the conversion between floating-point internal
    representations and string representations performed by the library functions in
    &lt;stdio.h&gt;, &lt;stdlib.h&gt;, and &lt;wchar.h&gt;. The implementation may state that the

    constant expressions. All except DECIMAL_DIG, FLT_EVAL_METHOD, FLT_RADIX,
    and FLT_ROUNDS have separate names for all three floating-point types. The floating-
    point model representation is provided for all values except FLT_EVAL_METHOD and
    FLT_ROUNDS.

     yielded by operators with floating operands and values subject to the usual arithmetic
     conversions and of floating constants are evaluated to a format whose range and precision

<pre>1   In the syntax notation used in this clause, syntactic categories (nonterminals) are
    indicated by italic type, and literal words and character set members (terminals) by bold
    type. A colon (:) following a nonterminal introduces its definition. Alternative
    definitions are listed on separate lines, except when prefaced by the words &lsquo;&lsquo;one of&rsquo;&rsquo;. An
    optional symbol is indicated by the subscript &lsquo;&lsquo;opt&rsquo;&rsquo;, so that
            { expressionopt }
    indicates an optional expression enclosed in braces.

<h3>6.2 [Concepts]</h3>
<a name='6.2.1'></a>
<hr>
<h3>6.2.1 [Scopes of identifiers]</h3>
<a name='6.2.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   An identifier can denote an object; a function; a tag or a member of a structure, union, or
    enumeration; a typedef name; a label name; a macro name; or a macro parameter. The
    same identifier can denote different entities at different points in the program. A member
    of an enumeration is called an enumeration constant. Macro names and macro
    parameters are not considered further here, because prior to the semantic phase of
    program translation any occurrences of macro names in the source file are replaced by the
    preprocessing token sequences that constitute their macro definitions.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   For each different entity that an identifier designates, the identifier is visible (i.e., can be
    used) only within a region of program text called its scope. Different entities designated
    by the same identifier either have different scopes, or are in different name spaces. There
    are four kinds of scopes: function, file, block, and function prototype. (A function
    prototype is a declaration of a function that declares the types of its parameters.)
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   A label name is the only kind of identifier that has function scope. It can be used (in a
    goto statement) anywhere in the function in which it appears, and is declared implicitly
    by its syntactic appearance (followed by a : and a statement).
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   Every other identifier has scope determined by the placement of its declaration (in a
    declarator or type specifier). If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier
    appears outside of any block or list of parameters, the identifier has file scope, which
    terminates at the end of the translation unit. If the declarator or type specifier that
    declares the identifier appears inside a block or within the list of parameter declarations in
    a function definition, the identifier has block scope, which terminates at the end of the
    associated block. If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier appears
    within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype (not part of a function
    definition), the identifier has function prototype scope, which terminates at the end of the
    function declarator. If an identifier designates two different entities in the same name
    space, the scopes might overlap. If so, the scope of one entity (the inner scope) will end
    strictly before the scope of the other entity (the outer scope). Within the inner scope, the
    identifier designates the entity declared in the inner scope; the entity declared in the outer
    scope is hidden (and not visible) within the inner scope.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, where this International Standard uses the term
    &lsquo;&lsquo;identifier&rsquo;&rsquo; to refer to some entity (as opposed to the syntactic construct), it refers to the
    entity in the relevant name space whose declaration is visible at the point the identifier
    occurs.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   Two identifiers have the same scope if and only if their scopes terminate at the same
    point.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p7'></a>
<pre>7   Structure, union, and enumeration tags have scope that begins just after the appearance of
    the tag in a type specifier that declares the tag. Each enumeration constant has scope that
    begins just after the appearance of its defining enumerator in an enumerator list. Any
    other identifier has scope that begins just after the completion of its declarator.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.1p8'></a>
<pre>8   As a special case, a type name (which is not a declaration of an identifier) is considered to
    have a scope that begins just after the place within the type name where the omitted
    identifier would appear were it not omitted.

<h3>6.2.2 [Linkages of identifiers]</h3>
<a name='6.2.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   An identifier declared in different scopes or in the same scope more than once can be
    made to refer to the same object or function by a process called linkage.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.29'><sup>[29]</sup></a> There are
    three kinds of linkage: external, internal, and none.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.29'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 29)</b> There is no linkage between different identifiers.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   In the set of translation units and libraries that constitutes an entire program, each
    declaration of a particular identifier with external linkage denotes the same object or
    function. Within one translation unit, each declaration of an identifier with internal
    linkage denotes the same object or function. Each declaration of an identifier with no
    linkage denotes a unique entity.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   If the declaration of a file scope identifier for an object or a function contains the storage-
    class specifier static, the identifier has internal linkage.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.30'><sup>[30]</sup></a>

    prior declaration of that identifier is visible,<a href='#FOOTNOTE.31'><sup>[31]</sup></a> if the prior declaration specifies internal or
    external linkage, the linkage of the identifier at the later declaration is the same as the
    linkage specified at the prior declaration. If no prior declaration is visible, or if the prior
    declaration specifies no linkage, then the identifier has external linkage.

<a name='6.2.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   If the declaration of an identifier for a function has no storage-class specifier, its linkage
    is determined exactly as if it were declared with the storage-class specifier extern. If
    the declaration of an identifier for an object has file scope and no storage-class specifier,
    its linkage is external.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.2p6'></a>
<pre>6   The following identifiers have no linkage: an identifier declared to be anything other than
    an object or a function; an identifier declared to be a function parameter; a block scope
    identifier for an object declared without the storage-class specifier extern.

<h3>6.2.3 [Name spaces of identifiers]</h3>

<pre>1   If more than one declaration of a particular identifier is visible at any point in a
    translation unit, the syntactic context disambiguates uses that refer to different entities.
    Thus, there are separate name spaces for various categories of identifiers, as follows:
    &mdash; label names (disambiguated by the syntax of the label declaration and use);
    &mdash; the tags of structures, unions, and enumerations (disambiguated by following any32)
      of the keywords struct, union, or enum);
    &mdash; the members of structures or unions; each structure or union has a separate name
      space for its members (disambiguated by the type of the expression used to access the
      member via the . or -&gt; operator);

<h3>6.2.4 [Storage durations of objects]</h3>
<a name='6.2.4p1'></a>
<pre>1   An object has a storage duration that determines its lifetime. There are four storage
    durations: static, thread, automatic, and allocated. Allocated storage is described in
    <a href='#7.22.3'>7.22.3</a>.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.4p2'></a>
<pre>2   The lifetime of an object is the portion of program execution during which storage is
    guaranteed to be reserved for it. An object exists, has a constant address,<a href='#FOOTNOTE.33'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and retains
    its last-stored value throughout its lifetime.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.34'><sup>[34]</sup></a> If an object is referred to outside of its
    lifetime, the behavior is undefined. The value of a pointer becomes indeterminate when
    the object it points to (or just past) reaches the end of its lifetime.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.33'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 33)</b> The term &lsquo;&lsquo;constant address&rsquo;&rsquo; means that two pointers to the object constructed at possibly different

<pre>3   An object whose identifier is declared without the storage-class specifier
    _Thread_local, and either with external or internal linkage or with the storage-class
    specifier static, has static storage duration. Its lifetime is the entire execution of the
    program and its stored value is initialized only once, prior to program startup.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.4p4'></a>
<pre>4   An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class specifier _Thread_local
    has thread storage duration. Its lifetime is the entire execution of the thread for which it
    is created, and its stored value is initialized when the thread is started. There is a distinct
    object per thread, and use of the declared name in an expression refers to the object
    associated with the thread evaluating the expression. The result of attempting to
    indirectly access an object with thread storage duration from a thread other than the one
    with which the object is associated is implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.4p5'></a>
<pre>5   An object whose identifier is declared with no linkage and without the storage-class
    specifier static has automatic storage duration, as do some compound literals. The
    result of attempting to indirectly access an object with automatic storage duration from a
    thread other than the one with which the object is associated is implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.4p6'></a>
<pre>6   For such an object that does not have a variable length array type, its lifetime extends
    from entry into the block with which it is associated until execution of that block ends in
    any way. (Entering an enclosed block or calling a function suspends, but does not end,
    execution of the current block.) If the block is entered recursively, a new instance of the
    object is created each time. The initial value of the object is indeterminate. If an
    initialization is specified for the object, it is performed each time the declaration or
    compound literal is reached in the execution of the block; otherwise, the value becomes
    indeterminate each time the declaration is reached.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.4p7'></a>
<pre>7   For such an object that does have a variable length array type, its lifetime extends from
    the declaration of the object until execution of the program leaves the scope of the
    declaration.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.35'><sup>[35]</sup></a> If the scope is entered recursively, a new instance of the object is created
    each time. The initial value of the object is indeterminate.

<pre>8   A non-lvalue expression with structure or union type, where the structure or union
    contains a member with array type (including, recursively, members of all contained
    structures and unions) refers to an object with automatic storage duration and temporary
    lifetime.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.36'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Its lifetime begins when the expression is evaluated and its initial value is the
    value of the expression. Its lifetime ends when the evaluation of the containing full
    expression or full declarator ends. Any attempt to modify an object with temporary
    lifetime results in undefined behavior.

    simplest such expression; the type is specified in the declaration of the identifier.) Types
    are partitioned into object types (types that describe objects) and function types (types
    that describe functions). At various points within a translation unit an object type may be
    incomplete (lacking sufficient information to determine the size of objects of that type) or

<pre>3   An object declared as type char is large enough to store any member of the basic

<pre>6    For each of the signed integer types, there is a corresponding (but different) unsigned
     integer type (designated with the keyword unsigned) that uses the same amount of
     storage (including sign information) and has the same alignment requirements. The type
     _Bool and the unsigned integer types that correspond to the standard signed integer
     types are the standard unsigned integer types. The unsigned integer types that
     correspond to the extended signed integer types are the extended unsigned integer types.

<pre>19   The void type comprises an empty set of values; it is an incomplete object type that
     cannot be completed.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p20'></a>
<pre>20   Any number of derived types can be constructed from the object and function types, as
     follows:
     &mdash; An array type describes a contiguously allocated nonempty set of objects with a
       particular member object type, called the element type. The element type shall be
       complete whenever the array type is specified. Array types are characterized by their
       element type and by the number of elements in the array. An array type is said to be
       derived from its element type, and if its element type is T , the array type is sometimes
       called &lsquo;&lsquo;array of T &rsquo;&rsquo;. The construction of an array type from an element type is called
       &lsquo;&lsquo;array type derivation&rsquo;&rsquo;.
     &mdash; A structure type describes a sequentially allocated nonempty set of member objects
       (and, in certain circumstances, an incomplete array), each of which has an optionally
       specified name and possibly distinct type.
     &mdash; A union type describes an overlapping nonempty set of member objects, each of
       which has an optionally specified name and possibly distinct type.
     &mdash; A function type describes a function with specified return type. A function type is
       characterized by its return type and the number and types of its parameters. A
       function type is said to be derived from its return type, and if its return type is T , the
       function type is sometimes called &lsquo;&lsquo;function returning T &rsquo;&rsquo;. The construction of a
       function type from a return type is called &lsquo;&lsquo;function type derivation&rsquo;&rsquo;.
     &mdash; A pointer type may be derived from a function type or an object type, called the
       referenced type. A pointer type describes an object whose value provides a reference
       to an entity of the referenced type. A pointer type derived from the referenced type T
       is sometimes called &lsquo;&lsquo;pointer to T &rsquo;&rsquo;. The construction of a pointer type from a
       referenced type is called &lsquo;&lsquo;pointer type derivation&rsquo;&rsquo;. A pointer type is a complete
       object type.
     &mdash; An atomic type describes the type designated by the construct _Atomic ( type-
       name ). (Atomic types are a conditional feature that implementations need not
       support; see <a href='#6.10.8.3'>6.10.8.3</a>.)
     These methods of constructing derived types can be applied recursively.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p21'></a>
<pre>21   Arithmetic types and pointer types are collectively called scalar types. Array and
     structure types are collectively called aggregate types.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.46'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.46'>

<a name='6.2.5p22'></a>
<pre>22   An array type of unknown size is an incomplete type. It is completed, for an identifier of
     that type, by specifying the size in a later declaration (with internal or external linkage).
     A structure or union type of unknown content (as described in <a href='#6.7.2.3'>6.7.2.3</a>) is an incomplete
     type. It is completed, for all declarations of that type, by declaring the same structure or
     union tag with its defining content later in the same scope.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p23'></a>
<pre>23   A type has known constant size if the type is not incomplete and is not a variable length
     array type.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p24'></a>
<pre>24   Array, function, and pointer types are collectively called derived declarator types. A
     declarator type derivation from a type T is the construction of a derived declarator type
     from T by the application of an array-type, a function-type, or a pointer-type derivation to
     T.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p25'></a>
<pre>25   A type is characterized by its type category, which is either the outermost derivation of a
     derived type (as noted above in the construction of derived types), or the type itself if the
     type consists of no derived types.
</pre>
<a name='6.2.5p26'></a>
<pre>26   Any type so far mentioned is an unqualified type. Each unqualified type has several
     qualified versions of its type,<a href='#FOOTNOTE.47'><sup>[47]</sup></a> corresponding to the combinations of one, two, or all
     three of the const, volatile, and restrict qualifiers. The qualified or unqualified
     versions of a type are distinct types that belong to the same type category and have the
     same representation and alignment requirements.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.48'><sup>[48]</sup></a> A derived type is not qualified by the
     qualifiers (if any) of the type from which it is derived.

<pre>27   Further, there is the _Atomic qualifier. The presence of the _Atomic qualifier
     designates an atomic type. The size, representation, and alignment of an atomic type
     need not be the same as those of the corresponding unqualified type. Therefore, this
     Standard explicitly uses the phrase &lsquo;&lsquo;atomic, qualified or unqualified type&rsquo;&rsquo; whenever the
     atomic version of a type is permitted along with the other qualified versions of a type.

<h3>6.3.1.8 [Usual arithmetic conversions]</h3>
<a name='6.3.1.8p1'></a>
<pre>1   Many operators that expect operands of arithmetic type cause conversions and yield result
    types in a similar way. The purpose is to determine a common real type for the operands
    and result. For the specified operands, each operand is converted, without change of type
    domain, to a type whose corresponding real type is the common real type. Unless
    explicitly stated otherwise, the common real type is also the corresponding real type of
    the result, whose type domain is the type domain of the operands if they are the same,
    and complex otherwise. This pattern is called the usual arithmetic conversions:
          First, if the corresponding real type of either operand is long double, the other
          operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose
           corresponding real type is long double.
           Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is double, the other
           operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose
           corresponding real type is double.
           Otherwise, if the corresponding real type of either operand is float, the other
           operand is converted, without change of type domain, to a type whose
           corresponding real type is float.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.62'><sup>[62]</sup></a>
           Otherwise, the integer promotions are performed on both operands. Then the
           following rules are applied to the promoted operands:
                  If both operands have the same type, then no further conversion is needed.
                  Otherwise, if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned
                  integer types, the operand with the type of lesser integer conversion rank is
                  converted to the type of the operand with greater rank.
                  Otherwise, if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or
                  equal to the rank of the type of the other operand, then the operand with
                  signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned
                  integer type.
                  Otherwise, if the type of the operand with signed integer type can represent
                  all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type, then
                  the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the
                  operand with signed integer type.
                  Otherwise, both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type
                  corresponding to the type of the operand with signed integer type.

<pre>4   If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a given character, the
    next preprocessing token is the longest sequence of characters that could constitute a
    preprocessing token. There is one exception to this rule: header name preprocessing
    tokens are recognized only within #include preprocessing directives and in
    implementation-defined locations within #pragma directives. In such contexts, a
    sequence of characters that could be either a header name or a string literal is recognized
    as the former.

<pre>5   EXAMPLE 1 The program fragment 1Ex is parsed as a preprocessing number token (one that is not a
    valid floating or integer constant token), even though a parse as the pair of preprocessing tokens 1 and Ex
    might produce a valid expression (for example, if Ex were a macro defined as +1). Similarly, the program
    fragment 1E1 is parsed as a preprocessing number (one that is a valid floating constant token), whether or
    not E is a macro name.

</pre>
<a name='6.4p6'></a>
<pre>6   EXAMPLE 2 The program fragment x+++++y is parsed as x ++ ++ + y, which violates a constraint on
    increment operators, even though the parse x ++ + ++ y might yield a correct expression.

<a name='6.4.4.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   A floating constant has a significand part that may be followed by an exponent part and a
    suffix that specifies its type. The components of the significand part may include a digit
    sequence representing the whole-number part, followed by a period (.), followed by a
    digit sequence representing the fraction part. The components of the exponent part are an
    e, E, p, or P followed by an exponent consisting of an optionally signed digit sequence.
    Either the whole-number part or the fraction part has to be present; for decimal floating
    constants, either the period or the exponent part has to be present.
    Semantics
</pre>
<a name='6.4.4.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   The significand part is interpreted as a (decimal or hexadecimal) rational number; the
    digit sequence in the exponent part is interpreted as a decimal integer. For decimal
    floating constants, the exponent indicates the power of 10 by which the significand part is
    to be scaled. For hexadecimal floating constants, the exponent indicates the power of 2
    by which the significand part is to be scaled. For decimal floating constants, and also for
    hexadecimal floating constants when FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, the result is either
    the nearest representable value, or the larger or smaller representable value immediately
    adjacent to the nearest representable value, chosen in an implementation-defined manner.
    For hexadecimal floating constants when FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, the result is
    correctly rounded.
</pre>
<a name='6.4.4.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   An unsuffixed floating constant has type double. If suffixed by the letter f or F, it has
    type float. If suffixed by the letter l or L, it has type long double.
</pre>
<a name='6.4.4.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   Floating constants are converted to internal format as if at translation-time. The
    conversion of a floating constant shall not raise an exceptional condition or a floating-
    point exception at execution time. All floating constants of the same source form<a href='#FOOTNOTE.75'><sup>[75]</sup></a> shall
    convert to the same internal format with the same value.

<a name='6.4.4.2p7'></a>
<pre>7   The translation-time conversion of floating constants should match the execution-time

<pre>10   An integer character constant has type int. The value of an integer character constant
     containing a single character that maps to a single-byte execution character is the
     numerical value of the representation of the mapped character interpreted as an integer.
     The value of an integer character constant containing more than one character (e.g.,
     &#39;ab&#39;), or containing a character or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte
     execution character, is implementation-defined. If an integer character constant contains
     a single character or escape sequence, its value is the one that results when an object with

     type int.

     is the wide character corresponding to that multibyte character, as defined by the
     mbtowc, mbrtoc16, or mbrtoc32 function as appropriate for its type, with an

<pre>14   EXAMPLE 3 Even if eight bits are used for objects that have type char, the construction &#39;\x123&#39;

    Semantics

<a name='6.5.2.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   A postfix expression followed by an expression in square brackets [] is a subscripted
    designation of an element of an array object. The definition of the subscript operator []
    is that E1[E2] is identical to (*((E1)+(E2))). Because of the conversion rules that
    apply to the binary + operator, if E1 is an array object (equivalently, a pointer to the
    initial element of an array object) and E2 is an integer, E1[E2] designates the E2-th
    element of E1 (counting from zero).
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   Successive subscript operators designate an element of a multidimensional array object.
    If E is an n-dimensional array (n &ge; 2) with dimensions i &times; j &times; . . . &times; k, then E (used as
    other than an lvalue) is converted to a pointer to an (n &minus; 1)-dimensional array with
    dimensions j &times; . . . &times; k. If the unary * operator is applied to this pointer explicitly, or
    implicitly as a result of subscripting, the result is the referenced (n &minus; 1)-dimensional
    array, which itself is converted into a pointer if used as other than an lvalue. It follows
    from this that arrays are stored in row-major order (last subscript varies fastest).
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   EXAMPLE        Consider the array object defined by the declaration
             int x[3][5];
    Here x is a 3 &times; 5 array of ints; more precisely, x is an array of three element objects, each of which is an
    array of five ints. In the expression x[i], which is equivalent to (*((x)+(i))), x is first converted to
    a pointer to the initial array of five ints. Then i is adjusted according to the type of x, which conceptually
    entails multiplying i by the size of the object to which the pointer points, namely an array of five int
    objects. The results are added and indirection is applied to yield an array of five ints. When used in the
    expression x[i][j], that array is in turn converted to a pointer to the first of the ints, so x[i][j]
    yields an int.

<pre>3   A postfix expression followed by parentheses () containing a possibly empty, comma-
    separated list of expressions is a function call. The postfix expression denotes the called
    function. The list of expressions specifies the arguments to the function.
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   An argument may be an expression of any complete object type. In preparing for the call
    to a function, the arguments are evaluated, and each parameter is assigned the value of the
    corresponding argument.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.93'><sup>[93]</sup></a>

<a name='FOOTNOTE.93'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 93)</b> A function may change the values of its parameters, but these changes cannot affect the values of the
        arguments. On the other hand, it is possible to pass a pointer to an object, and the function may
        change the value of the object pointed to. A parameter declared to have array or function type is
        adjusted to have a pointer type as described in <a href='#6.9.1'>6.9.1</a>.

<a name='6.5.2.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   If the expression that denotes the called function has type pointer to function returning an
    object type, the function call expression has the same type as that object type, and has the
    value determined as specified in <a href='#6.8.6.4'>6.8.6.4</a>. Otherwise, the function call has type void.
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.2p6'></a>
<pre>6   If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a
    prototype, the integer promotions are performed on each argument, and arguments that
    have type float are promoted to double. These are called the default argument
    promotions. If the number of arguments does not equal the number of parameters, the
    behavior is undefined. If the function is defined with a type that includes a prototype, and
    either the prototype ends with an ellipsis (, ...) or the types of the arguments after
    promotion are not compatible with the types of the parameters, the behavior is undefined.
    If the function is defined with a type that does not include a prototype, and the types of
    the arguments after promotion are not compatible with those of the parameters after
    promotion, the behavior is undefined, except for the following cases:
    &mdash; one promoted type is a signed integer type, the other promoted type is the
      corresponding unsigned integer type, and the value is representable in both types;
     &mdash; both types are pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of a character type or
       void.
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.2p7'></a>
<pre>7    If the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does include a prototype,
     the arguments are implicitly converted, as if by assignment, to the types of the
     corresponding parameters, taking the type of each parameter to be the unqualified version
     of its declared type. The ellipsis notation in a function prototype declarator causes
     argument type conversion to stop after the last declared parameter. The default argument
     promotions are performed on trailing arguments.
</pre>
<a name='6.5.2.2p8'></a>
<pre>8    No other conversions are performed implicitly; in particular, the number and types of
     arguments are not compared with those of the parameters in a function definition that
     does not include a function prototype declarator.

<pre>3   The unary &amp; operator yields the address of its operand. If the operand has type &lsquo;&lsquo;type&rsquo;&rsquo;,
    the result has type &lsquo;&lsquo;pointer to type&rsquo;&rsquo;. If the operand is the result of a unary * operator,
    neither that operator nor the &amp; operator is evaluated and the result is as if both were
    omitted, except that the constraints on the operators still apply and the result is not an

    the unary * that is implied by the [] is evaluated and the result is as if the &amp; operator
    were removed and the [] operator were changed to a + operator. Otherwise, the result is
    a pointer to the object or function designated by its operand.

            extern void *alloc(size_t);

     field, then to the unit in which it resides), and vice versa.

<pre>17   There may be unnamed padding at the end of a structure or union.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.2.1p18'></a>
<pre>18   As a special case, the last element of a structure with more than one named member may
     have an incomplete array type; this is called a flexible array member. In most situations,
     the flexible array member is ignored. In particular, the size of the structure is as if the
     flexible array member were omitted except that it may have more trailing padding than
     the omission would imply. However, when a . (or -&gt;) operator has a left operand that is
     (a pointer to) a structure with a flexible array member and the right operand names that
     member, it behaves as if that member were replaced with the longest array (with the same
     element type) that would not make the structure larger than the object being accessed; the
     offset of the array shall remain that of the flexible array member, even if this would differ
     from that of the replacement array. If this array would have no elements, it behaves as if
     it had one element but the behavior is undefined if any attempt is made to access that
     element or to generate a pointer one past it.

<pre>19   EXAMPLE 1    The following illustrates anonymous structures and unions:
            struct v {
                  union {      // anonymous union
                         struct { int i, j; };    // anonymous structure
                         struct { long k, l; } w;
                  };
                  int m;
            } v1;
              v1.i = 2;   // valid
              v1.k = 3;   // invalid: inner structure is not anonymous

<pre>20   EXAMPLE 2          After the declaration:
              struct s { int n; double d[]; };
     the structure struct s has a flexible array member d. A typical way to use this is:
              int m = /* some value */;
              struct s *p = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + sizeof (double [m]));
     and assuming that the call to malloc succeeds, the object pointed to by p behaves, for most purposes, as if
     p had been declared as:
              struct { int n; double d[m]; } *p;
     (there are circumstances in which this equivalence is broken; in particular, the offsets of member d might
     not be the same).
</pre>
<a name='6.7.2.1p21'></a>
<pre>21   Following the above declaration:
              struct s t1 = { 0 };                         // valid
              struct s t2 = { 1, { 4.2 }};                 // invalid
              t1.n = 4;                                    // valid
              t1.d[0] = 4.2;                               // might be undefined behavior
     The initialization of t2 is invalid (and violates a constraint) because struct s is treated as if it did not
     contain member d. The assignment to t1.d[0] is probably undefined behavior, but it is possible that
              sizeof (struct s) &gt;= offsetof(struct s, d) + sizeof (double)
     in which case the assignment would be legitimate. Nevertheless, it cannot appear in strictly conforming
     code.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.2.1p22'></a>
<pre>22   After the further declaration:
              struct ss { int n; };
     the expressions:
              sizeof (struct s) &gt;= sizeof (struct ss)

     are always equal to 1.

              s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 64);
              s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 46);
     and assuming that the calls to malloc succeed, the objects pointed to by s1 and s2 behave, for most
     purposes, as if the identifiers had been declared as:
              struct { int n; double d[8]; } *s1;
              struct { int n; double d[5]; } *s2;
</pre>

              s1 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 10);
              s2 = malloc(sizeof (struct s) + 6);
     they then behave as if the declarations were:
              struct { int n; double d[1]; } *s1, *s2;
     and:
              double *dp;
              dp = &amp;(s1-&gt;d[0]); // valid
              *dp = 42;         // valid
              dp = &amp;(s2-&gt;d[0]); // valid
              *dp = 42;         // undefined behavior
</pre>
<a name='6.7.2.1p25'></a>
<pre>25   The assignment:
              *s1 = *s2;
     only copies the member n; if any of the array elements are within the first sizeof (struct s) bytes
     of the structure, they might be copied or simply overwritten with indeterminate values.

<a name='6.7.2.1p26'></a>
<pre>26   EXAMPLE 3 Because members of anonymous structures and unions are considered to be members of the
     containing structure or union, struct s in the following example has more than one named member and
     thus the use of a flexible array member is valid:
              struct s {
                    struct { int i; };
                    int a[];

     may be inserted ahead of D1. This declares a new tag s2 in the inner scope; the declaration D2 then

<a name='6.7.3.1p1'></a>
<pre>1    Let D be a declaration of an ordinary identifier that provides a means of designating an
     object P as a restrict-qualified pointer to type T.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p2'></a>
<pre>2    If D appears inside a block and does not have storage class extern, let B denote the
     block. If D appears in the list of parameter declarations of a function definition, let B
     denote the associated block. Otherwise, let B denote the block of main (or the block of
     whatever function is called at program startup in a freestanding environment).
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p3'></a>
<pre>3    In what follows, a pointer expression E is said to be based on object P if (at some
     sequence point in the execution of B prior to the evaluation of E) modifying P to point to
     a copy of the array object into which it formerly pointed would change the value of E.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.137'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
     Note that &lsquo;&lsquo;based&rsquo;&rsquo; is defined only for expressions with pointer types.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.137'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 137)</b> In other words, E depends on the value of P itself rather than on the value of an object referenced
          indirectly through P. For example, if identifier p has type (int **restrict), then the pointer
          expressions p and p+1 are based on the restricted pointer object designated by p, but the pointer
          expressions *p and p[1] are not.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='6.7.3.1p4'></a>
<pre>4    During each execution of B, let L be any lvalue that has &amp;L based on P. If L is used to
     access the value of the object X that it designates, and X is also modified (by any means),
     then the following requirements apply: T shall not be const-qualified. Every other lvalue
     used to access the value of X shall also have its address based on P. Every access that
     modifies X shall be considered also to modify P, for the purposes of this subclause. If P
     is assigned the value of a pointer expression E that is based on another restricted pointer
     object P2, associated with block B2, then either the execution of B2 shall begin before
     the execution of B, or the execution of B2 shall end prior to the assignment. If these
     requirements are not met, then the behavior is undefined.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p5'></a>

<pre>7    EXAMPLE 1       The file scope declarations
              int * restrict a;
              int * restrict b;
              extern int c[];
     assert that if an object is accessed using one of a, b, or c, and that object is modified anywhere in the
     program, then it is never accessed using either of the other two.

</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p8'></a>
<pre>8    EXAMPLE 2       The function parameter declarations in the following example
              void f(int n, int * restrict p, int * restrict q)
              {
                    while (n-- &gt; 0)
                          *p++ = *q++;
              }
     assert that, during each execution of the function, if an object is accessed through one of the pointer
     parameters, then it is not also accessed through the other.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p9'></a>
<pre>9    The benefit of the restrict qualifiers is that they enable a translator to make an effective dependence
     analysis of function f without examining any of the calls of f in the program. The cost is that the
     programmer has to examine all of those calls to ensure that none give undefined behavior. For example, the
     second call of f in g has undefined behavior because each of d[1] through d[49] is accessed through
     both p and q.
              void g(void)
              {
                    extern int d[100];
                    f(50, d + 50, d); // valid
                    f(50, d + 1, d); // undefined behavior
              }

<a name='6.7.3.1p10'></a>
<pre>10   EXAMPLE 3       The function parameter declarations

              {
                    int i;
                    for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
                           p[i] = q[i] + r[i];
              }
     illustrate how an unmodified object can be aliased through two restricted pointers. In particular, if a and b
     are disjoint arrays, a call of the form h(100, a, b, b) has defined behavior, because array b is not
     modified within function h.
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p11'></a>
<pre>11   EXAMPLE 4 The rule limiting assignments between restricted pointers does not distinguish between a
     function call and an equivalent nested block. With one exception, only &lsquo;&lsquo;outer-to-inner&rsquo;&rsquo; assignments
     between restricted pointers declared in nested blocks have defined behavior.
              {
                       int * restrict p1;
                       int * restrict q1;
                       p1 = q1; // undefined behavior
                       {
                             int * restrict p2 = p1; // valid
                             int * restrict q2 = q1; // valid
                             p1 = q2;                 // undefined behavior
                             p2 = q2;                 // undefined behavior
                       }
              }
</pre>
<a name='6.7.3.1p12'></a>
<pre>12   The one exception allows the value of a restricted pointer to be carried out of the block in which it (or, more
     precisely, the ordinary identifier used to designate it) is declared when that block finishes execution. For
     example, this permits new_vector to return a vector.
              typedef struct { int n; float * restrict v; } vector;
              vector new_vector(int n)

</pre>
<a name='6.7.4p6'></a>
<pre>6    A function declared with an inline function specifier is an inline function. Making a
     function an inline function suggests that calls to the function be as fast as possible.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.138'><sup>[138]</sup></a>

          Therefore, for example, the expansion of a macro used within the body of the function uses the
          definition it had at the point the function body appears, and not where the function is called; and
          identifiers refer to the declarations in scope where the body occurs. Likewise, the function has a

<a name='6.7.4p7'></a>
<pre>7    Any function with internal linkage can be an inline function. For a function with external
     linkage, the following restrictions apply: If a function is declared with an inline
     function specifier, then it shall also be defined in the same translation unit. If all of the
     file scope declarations for a function in a translation unit include the inline function
     specifier without extern, then the definition in that translation unit is an inline
     definition. An inline definition does not provide an external definition for the function,
     and does not forbid an external definition in another translation unit. An inline definition
     provides an alternative to an external definition, which a translator may use to implement
     any call to the function in the same translation unit. It is unspecified whether a call to the
     function uses the inline definition or the external definition.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.140'><sup>[140]</sup></a>

<a name='6.7.4p10'></a>
<pre>10   EXAMPLE 1 The declaration of an inline function with external linkage can result in either an external
     definition, or a definition available for use only within the translation unit. A file scope declaration with
     extern creates an external definition. The following example shows an entire translation unit.
              inline double fahr(double t)
              {
                    return (9.0 * t) / 5.0 + 32.0;

                    return (5.0 * (t - 32.0)) / 9.0;
              }
              extern double fahr(double);                   // creates an external definition

              }
</pre>
<a name='6.7.4p11'></a>
<pre>11   Note that the definition of fahr is an external definition because fahr is also declared with extern, but
     the definition of cels is an inline definition. Because cels has external linkage and is referenced, an
     external definition has to appear in another translation unit (see <a href='#6.9'>6.9</a>); the inline definition and the external
     definition are distinct and either may be used for the call.

    declarators are evaluated each time the declaration of the typedef name is reached in the

    synonym for the type so specified. That is, in the following declarations:
             typedef T type_ident;
             type_ident D;
    type_ident is defined as a typedef name with the type specified by the declaration
    specifiers in T (known as T ), and the identifier in D has the type &lsquo;&lsquo;derived-declarator-
    type-list T &rsquo;&rsquo; where the derived-declarator-type-list is specified by the declarators of D. A

             typedef signed int t;
             typedef int plain;
             struct tag {

             };
    declare a typedef name t with type signed int, a typedef name plain with type int, and a structure
    with three bit-field members, one named t that contains values in the range [0, 15], an unnamed const-
    qualified bit-field which (if it could be accessed) would contain values in either the range [&minus;15, +15] or
    [&minus;16, +15], and one named r that contains values in one of the ranges [0, 31], [&minus;15, +15], or [&minus;16, +15].
    (The choice of range is implementation-defined.) The first two bit-field declarations differ in that
    unsigned is a type specifier (which forces t to be the name of a structure member), while const is a
    type qualifier (which modifies t which is still visible as a typedef name). If these declarations are followed
    in an inner scope by
             t f(t (t));
             long t;
    then a function f is declared with type &lsquo;&lsquo;function returning signed int with one unnamed parameter
    with type pointer to function returning signed int with one unnamed parameter with type signed
    int&rsquo;&rsquo;, and an identifier t with type long int.

<pre>25   EXAMPLE 2        The declaration

     is a definition with a fully bracketed initialization: 1, 3, and 5 initialize the first row of y (the array object
     y[0]), namely y[0][0], y[0][1], and y[0][2]. Likewise the next two lines initialize y[1] and
     y[2]. The initializer ends early, so y[3] is initialized with zeros. Precisely the same effect could have

     contains an incompletely but consistently bracketed initialization. It defines a three-dimensional array
     object: q[0][0][0] is 1, q[1][0][0] is 2, q[1][0][1] is 3, and 4, 5, and 6 initialize
     q[2][0][0], q[2][0][1], and q[2][1][0], respectively; all the rest are zero. The initializer for
     q[0][0] does not begin with a left brace, so up to six items from the current list may be used. There is
     only one, so the values for the remaining five elements are initialized with zero. Likewise, the initializers
     for q[1][0] and q[2][0] do not begin with a left brace, so each uses up to six items, initializing their
     respective two-dimensional subaggregates. If there had been more than six items in any of the lists, a

<pre>32   EXAMPLE 8       The declaration

     defines &lsquo;&lsquo;plain&rsquo;&rsquo; char array objects s and t whose elements are initialized with character string literals.
     This declaration is identical to

                   t[] = { &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; };
     The contents of the arrays are modifiable. On the other hand, the declaration
              char *p = &quot;abc&quot;;
     defines p with type &lsquo;&lsquo;pointer to char&rsquo;&rsquo; and initializes it to point to an object with type &lsquo;&lsquo;array of char&rsquo;&rsquo;

<pre>4   As discussed in <a href='#5.1.1.1'>5.1.1.1</a>, the unit of program text after preprocessing is a translation unit,
    which consists of a sequence of external declarations. These are described as &lsquo;&lsquo;external&rsquo;&rsquo;
    because they appear outside any function (and hence have file scope). As discussed in
    <a href='#6.7'>6.7</a>, a declaration that also causes storage to be reserved for an object or a function named
    by the identifier is a definition.
</pre>
<a name='6.9p5'></a>
<pre>5   An external definition is an external declaration that is also a definition of a function

    Description
</pre>
<a name='6.10p2'></a>
<pre>2   A preprocessing directive consists of a sequence of preprocessing tokens that satisfies the
    following constraints: The first token in the sequence is a # preprocessing token that (at
    the start of translation phase 4) is either the first character in the source file (optionally
    after white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows white space
    containing at least one new-line character. The last token in the sequence is the first new-
    line character that follows the first token in the sequence.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.165'><sup>[165]</sup></a> A new-line character ends
    the preprocessing directive even if it occurs within what would otherwise be an
    invocation of a function-like macro.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.165'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 165)</b> Thus, preprocessing directives are commonly called &lsquo;&lsquo;lines&rsquo;&rsquo;. These &lsquo;&lsquo;lines&rsquo;&rsquo; have no other syntactic
         significance, as all white space is equivalent except in certain situations during preprocessing (see the
         # character string literal creation operator in <a href='#6.10.3.2'>6.10.3.2</a>, for example).

<pre>4   When in a group that is skipped (<a href='#6.10.1'>6.10.1</a>), the directive syntax is relaxed to allow any
    sequence of preprocessing tokens to occur between the directive name and the following
    new-line character.
    Constraints
</pre>
<a name='6.10p5'></a>
<pre>5   The only white-space characters that shall appear between preprocessing tokens within a
    preprocessing directive (from just after the introducing # preprocessing token through

    spaces that have replaced comments or possibly other white-space characters in
    translation phase 3).
    Semantics
</pre>
<a name='6.10p6'></a>
<pre>6   The implementation can process and skip sections of source files conditionally, include
    other source files, and replace macros. These capabilities are called preprocessing,
    because conceptually they occur before translation of the resulting translation unit.
</pre>
<a name='6.10p7'></a>
<pre>7   The preprocessing tokens within a preprocessing directive are not subject to macro
    expansion unless otherwise stated.

<pre>8   EXAMPLE        In:
             #define EMPTY
             EMPTY # include &lt;file.h&gt;
    the sequence of preprocessing tokens on the second line is not a preprocessing directive, because it does not
    begin with a # at the start of translation phase 4, even though it will do so after the macro EMPTY has been
    replaced.

              required set, when stored in an object of type wchar_t, has the same
              value as the short identifier of that character. The Unicode required set

<pre>1 Semantics
   A unary operator expression of the form:
       _Pragma ( string-literal )
    is processed as follows: The string literal is destringized by deleting any encoding prefix,
    deleting the leading and trailing double-quotes, replacing each escape sequence \&quot; by a
    double-quote, and replacing each escape sequence \\ by a single backslash. The
    resulting sequence of characters is processed through translation phase 3 to produce
    preprocessing tokens that are executed as if they were the pp-tokens in a pragma
    directive. The original four preprocessing tokens in the unary operator expression are
    removed.

    processing given to multibyte characters contained in the string or to avoid confusion
    with a wide string. A pointer to a string is a pointer to its initial (lowest addressed)
    character. The length of a string is the number of bytes preceding the null character and
    the value of a string is the sequence of the values of the contained characters, in order.

<h3>7.1.4 [Use of library functions]</h3>
<a name='7.1.4p1'></a>
<pre>1   Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly stated otherwise in the detailed
    descriptions that follow: If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a value
    outside the domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program,
    or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
    parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a function
    with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined. If a function argument is
    described as being an array, the pointer actually passed to the function shall have a value
    such that all address computations and accesses to objects (that would be valid if the
    pointer did point to the first element of such an array) are in fact valid. Any function
    declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro defined in
    the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one
    of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by
    such a macro. Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing
    the name of the function in parentheses, because the name is then not followed by the left
    parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic
    reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as
    a macro.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.185'><sup>[185]</sup></a> The use of #undef to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an
    actual function is referred to. Any invocation of a library function that is implemented as
    a macro shall expand to code that evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully
    protected by parentheses where necessary, so it is generally safe to use arbitrary
    expressions as arguments.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.186'><sup>[186]</sup></a> Likewise, those function-like macros described in the
    following subclauses may be invoked in an expression anywhere a function with a
    compatible return type could be called.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.187'><sup>[187]</sup></a> All object-like macros listed as expanding to
    integer constant expressions shall additionally be suitable for use in #if preprocessing
    directives.

<pre><i><b>Footnote 187)</b> Because external identifiers and some macro names beginning with an underscore are reserved,
         implementations may provide special semantics for such names. For example, the identifier
         _BUILTIN_abs could be used to indicate generation of in-line code for the abs function. Thus, the
         appropriate header could specify
                  #define abs(x) _BUILTIN_abs(x)
         for a compiler whose code generator will accept it.
         In this manner, a user desiring to guarantee that a given library function such as abs will be a genuine
         function may write
                  #undef abs
         whether the implementation&rsquo;s header provides a macro implementation of abs or a built-in
         implementation. The prototype for the function, which precedes and is hidden by any macro

    implementations) that follow the specifications of annex G, the sign of zero distinguishes
    one side of a cut from another so the function is continuous (except for format
    limitations) as the cut is approached from either side. For example, for the square root
    function, which has a branch cut along the negative real axis, the top of the cut, with
    imaginary part +0, maps to the positive imaginary axis, and the bottom of the cut, with
    imaginary part &minus;0, maps to the negative imaginary axis.
</pre>
<a name='7.3.3p2'></a>
<pre>2   Implementations that do not support a signed zero (see annex F) cannot distinguish the
    sides of branch cuts. These implementations shall map a cut so the function is continuous
    as the cut is approached coming around the finite endpoint of the cut in a counter
    clockwise direction. (Branch cuts for the functions specified here have just one finite
    endpoint.) For example, for the square root function, coming counter clockwise around
    the finite endpoint of the cut along the negative real axis approaches the cut from above,
    so the cut maps to the positive imaginary axis.

</a>
<a name='7.5p3'></a>
<pre>3   The value of errno in the initial thread is zero at program startup (the initial value of

     Description
</pre>
<a name='7.6.1p2'></a>
<pre>2    The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implementation when a
     program might access the floating-point environment to test floating-point status flags or
     run under non-default floating-point control modes.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.213'><sup>[213]</sup></a> The pragma shall occur either
     outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements inside a
     compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes effect from
     its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or until the end of
     the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes effect from its
     occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within a
     nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at the end of a
     compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the
     compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is
     undefined. If part of a program tests floating-point status flags, sets floating-point control
     modes, or runs under non-default mode settings, but was translated with the state for the
     FENV_ACCESS pragma &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;, the behavior is undefined. The default state (&lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; or
     &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;) for the pragma is implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part of
     the program translated with FENV_ACCESS &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo; to a part translated with
     FENV_ACCESS &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;, the state of the floating-point status flags is unspecified and the
     floating-point control modes have their default settings.)
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.213'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 213)</b> The purpose of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is to allow certain optimizations that could subvert flag
          tests and mode changes (e.g., global common subexpression elimination, code motion, and constant
          folding). In general, if the state of FENV_ACCESS is &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;, the translator can assume that default
          modes are in effect and the flags are not tested.

</pre>
<a name='7.11.1.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The setlocale function selects the appropriate portion of the program&rsquo;s locale as
    specified by the category and locale arguments. The setlocale function may be
    used to change or query the program&rsquo;s entire current locale or portions thereof. The value
    LC_ALL for category names the program&rsquo;s entire locale; the other values for
    category name only a portion of the program&rsquo;s locale. LC_COLLATE affects the
    behavior of the strcoll and strxfrm functions. LC_CTYPE affects the behavior of
    the character handling functions<a href='#FOOTNOTE.224'><sup>[224]</sup></a> and the multibyte and wide character functions.
    LC_MONETARY affects the monetary formatting information returned by the
    localeconv function. LC_NUMERIC affects the decimal-point character for the
    formatted input/output functions and the string conversion functions, as well as the
    nonmonetary formatting information returned by the localeconv function. LC_TIME
    affects the behavior of the strftime and wcsftime functions.

<pre>1   The header &lt;math.h&gt; declares two types and many mathematical functions and defines
    several macros. Most synopses specify a family of functions consisting of a principal
    function with one or more double parameters, a double return value, or both; and
    other functions with the same name but with f and l suffixes, which are corresponding
    functions with float and long double parameters, return values, or both.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.226'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
    Integer arithmetic functions and conversion functions are discussed later.

<pre>2   The types
            float_t
            double_t
    are floating types at least as wide as float and double, respectively, and such that
    double_t is at least as wide as float_t. If FLT_EVAL_METHOD equals 0,
    float_t and double_t are float and double, respectively; if
    FLT_EVAL_METHOD equals 1, they are both double; if FLT_EVAL_METHOD equals
    2, they are both long double; and for other values of FLT_EVAL_METHOD, they are
    otherwise implementation-defined.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.227'><sup>[227]</sup></a>

<pre>3   The macro
            HUGE_VAL
    expands to a positive double constant expression, not necessarily representable as a
    float. The macros
            HUGE_VALF
            HUGE_VALL
    are respectively float and long double analogs of HUGE_VAL.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.228'><sup>[228]</sup></a>

<pre>4   The macro
            INFINITY
    expands to a constant expression of type float representing positive or unsigned
    infinity, if available; else to a positive constant of type float that overflows at
    translation time.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.229'><sup>[229]</sup></a>

<pre>5   The macro

    is defined if and only if the implementation supports quiet NaNs for the float type. It
    expands to a constant expression of type float representing a quiet NaN.

             FP_NORMAL
             FP_SUBNORMAL

    constant expressions with distinct values. Additional implementation-defined floating-
    point classifications, with macro definitions beginning with FP_ and an uppercase letter,
    may also be specified by the implementation.

<a name='7.12p7'></a>
<pre>7   The macro
             FP_FAST_FMA

<pre>8   The macros

    expand to integer constant expressions whose values are returned by ilogb(x) if x is
    zero or NaN, respectively. The value of FP_ILOGB0 shall be either INT_MIN or
    -INT_MAX. The value of FP_ILOGBNAN shall be either INT_MAX or INT_MIN.

<pre>9   The macros
            MATH_ERRNO
            MATH_ERREXCEPT
    expand to the integer constants 1 and 2, respectively; the macro
            math_errhandling
    expands to an expression that has type int and the value MATH_ERRNO,
    MATH_ERREXCEPT, or the bitwise OR of both. The value of math_errhandling is
    constant for the duration of the program. It is unspecified whether
    math_errhandling is a macro or an identifier with external linkage. If a macro
    definition is suppressed or a program defines an identifier with the name
    math_errhandling, the behavior is undefined.              If the expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT can be nonzero, the implementation
    shall define the macros FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW in

<h3>7.12.1 [Treatment of error conditions]</h3>
<a name='7.12.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   The behavior of each of the functions in &lt;math.h&gt; is specified for all representable
    values of its input arguments, except where stated otherwise. Each function shall execute
    as if it were a single operation without raising SIGFPE and without generating any of the
    floating-point exceptions &lsquo;&lsquo;invalid&rsquo;&rsquo;, &lsquo;&lsquo;divide-by-zero&rsquo;&rsquo;, or &lsquo;&lsquo;overflow&rsquo;&rsquo; except to reflect
    the result of the function.
</pre>
<a name='7.12.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   For all functions, a domain error occurs if an input argument is outside the domain over
    which the mathematical function is defined. The description of each function lists any
    required domain errors; an implementation may define additional domain errors, provided
    that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.231'><sup>[231]</sup></a> On a
    domain error, the function returns an implementation-defined value; if the integer
    expression math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, the integer expression
    errno acquires the value EDOM; if the integer expression math_errhandling &amp;
    MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the &lsquo;&lsquo;invalid&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-point exception is raised.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.231'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 231)</b> In an implementation that supports infinities, this allows an infinity as an argument to be a domain
         error if the mathematical domain of the function does not include the infinity.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.12.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   Similarly, a pole error (also known as a singularity or infinitary) occurs if the
    mathematical function has an exact infinite result as the finite input argument(s) are
    approached in the limit (for example, log(0.0)). The description of each function lists
    any required pole errors; an implementation may define additional pole errors, provided
    that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function. On a pole
    error, the function returns an implementation-defined value; if the integer expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, the integer expression errno
    acquires the value ERANGE; if the integer expression math_errhandling &amp;
    MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the &lsquo;&lsquo;divide-by-zero&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-point exception is raised.
</pre>
<a name='7.12.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   Likewise, a range error occurs if the mathematical result of the function cannot be
    represented in an object of the specified type, due to extreme magnitude.
</pre>
<a name='7.12.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   A floating result overflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is finite but so
    large that the mathematical result cannot be represented without extraordinary roundoff
    error in an object of the specified type. If a floating result overflows and default rounding
    is in effect, then the function returns the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or
    HUGE_VALL according to the return type, with the same sign as the correct value of the
    function; if the integer expression math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero,
    the integer expression errno acquires the value ERANGE; if the integer expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, the &lsquo;&lsquo;overflow&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-
    point exception is raised.
</pre>
<a name='7.12.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is so small that the
    mathematical result cannot be represented, without extraordinary roundoff error, in an
    object of the specified type.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.232'><sup>[232]</sup></a> If the result underflows, the function returns an
    implementation-defined value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest
    normalized positive number in the specified type; if the integer expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO is nonzero, whether errno acquires the
    value     ERANGE       is    implementation-defined;     if   the integer  expression
    math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT is nonzero, whether the &lsquo;&lsquo;underflow&rsquo;&rsquo;
    floating-point exception is raised is implementation-defined.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.12.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The FP_CONTRACT pragma can be used to allow (if the state is &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;) or disallow (if the
    state is &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;) the implementation to contract expressions (<a href='#6.5'>6.5</a>). Each pragma can occur
    either outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements
    inside a compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes
    effect from its occurrence until another FP_CONTRACT pragma is encountered, or until
    the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes
    effect from its occurrence until another FP_CONTRACT pragma is encountered
    (including within a nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound
    statement; at the end of a compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its
    condition just before the compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other
    context, the behavior is undefined. The default state (&lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo; or &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;) for the pragma is
    implementation-defined.

<a name='7.12.3.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The fpclassify macro classifies its argument value as NaN, infinite, normal,
    subnormal, zero, or into another implementation-defined category. First, an argument
    represented in a format wider than its semantic type is converted to its semantic type.

</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.234'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 234)</b> Since an expression can be evaluated with more range and precision than its type has, it is important to
         know the type that classification is based on. For example, a normal long double value might
         become subnormal when converted to double, and zero when converted to float.

<h3>7.14 [Signal handling &lt;signal.h&gt;]</h3>
<a name='7.14p1'></a>
<pre>1   The header &lt;signal.h&gt; declares a type and two functions and defines several macros,
    for handling various signals (conditions that may be reported during program execution).
</pre>
<a name='7.14p2'></a>
<pre>2   The type defined is
             sig_atomic_t
    which is the (possibly volatile-qualified) integer type of an object that can be accessed as
    an atomic entity, even in the presence of asynchronous interrupts.
</pre>
<a name='7.14p3'></a>
<pre>3   The macros defined are
             SIG_DFL
             SIG_ERR
             SIG_IGN
    which expand to constant expressions with distinct values that have type compatible with
    the second argument to, and the return value of, the signal function, and whose values
    compare unequal to the address of any declarable function; and the following, which
    expand to positive integer constant expressions with type int and distinct values that are
    the signal numbers, each corresponding to the specified condition:
             SIGABRT abnormal termination, such as is initiated by the abort function
             SIGFPE        an erroneous arithmetic operation, such as zero divide or an operation
                           resulting in overflow
             SIGILL        detection of an invalid function image, such as an invalid instruction
             SIGINT        receipt of an interactive attention signal
             SIGSEGV an invalid access to storage
             SIGTERM a termination request sent to the program
</pre>
<a name='7.14p4'></a>
<pre>4   An implementation need not generate any of these signals, except as a result of explicit
    calls to the raise function. Additional signals and pointers to undeclarable functions,
    with macro definitions beginning, respectively, with the letters SIG and an uppercase
    letter or with SIG_ and an uppercase letter,<a href='#FOOTNOTE.250'><sup>[250]</sup></a> may also be specified by the
    implementation. The complete set of signals, their semantics, and their default handling
    is implementation-defined; all signal numbers shall be positive.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.250'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 250)</b> See &lsquo;&lsquo;future library directions&rsquo;&rsquo; (<a href='#7.31.7'>7.31.7</a>). The names of the signal numbers reflect the following terms
         (respectively): abort, floating-point exception, illegal instruction, interrupt, segmentation violation,
         and termination.

<a name='7.14.1.1p1'></a>
<pre>1 Synopsis
            #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
             void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);
    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.14.1.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The signal function chooses one of three ways in which receipt of the signal number
    sig is to be subsequently handled. If the value of func is SIG_DFL, default handling
    for that signal will occur. If the value of func is SIG_IGN, the signal will be ignored.
    Otherwise, func shall point to a function to be called when that signal occurs. An
    invocation of such a function because of a signal, or (recursively) of any further functions
    called by that invocation (other than functions in the standard library),<a href='#FOOTNOTE.251'><sup>[251]</sup></a> is called a
    signal handler.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.251'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 251)</b> This includes functions called indirectly via standard library functions (e.g., a SIGABRT handler
         called via the abort function).
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.14.1.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   When a signal occurs and func points to a function, it is implementation-defined
    whether the equivalent of signal(sig, SIG_DFL); is executed or the
    implementation prevents some implementation-defined set of signals (at least including
    sig) from occurring until the current signal handling has completed; in the case of
    SIGILL, the implementation may alternatively define that no action is taken. Then the
    equivalent of (*func)(sig); is executed. If and when the function returns, if the
    value of sig is SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGSEGV, or any other implementation-defined
    value corresponding to a computational exception, the behavior is undefined; otherwise
    the program will resume execution at the point it was interrupted.
</pre>
<a name='7.14.1.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   If the signal occurs as the result of calling the abort or raise function, the signal
    handler shall not call the raise function.
</pre>
<a name='7.14.1.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   If the signal occurs other than as the result of calling the abort or raise function, the
    behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any object with static or thread
    storage duration that is not a lock-free atomic object other than by assigning a value to an
    object declared as volatile sig_atomic_t, or the signal handler calls any function
    in the standard library other than the abort function, the _Exit function, the
    quick_exit function, or the signal function with the first argument equal to the
    signal number corresponding to the signal that caused the invocation of the handler.
    Furthermore, if such a call to the signal function results in a SIG_ERR return, the
    value of errno is indeterminate.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.252'><sup>[252]</sup></a>

<pre>6   At program startup, the equivalent of
           signal(sig, SIG_IGN);
    may be executed for some signals selected in an implementation-defined manner; the
    equivalent of
           signal(sig, SIG_DFL);
    is executed for all other signals defined by the implementation.
</pre>
<a name='7.14.1.1p7'></a>
<pre>7   Use of this function in a multi-threaded program results in undefined behavior. The
    implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the signal function.
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='7.14.1.1p8'></a>
<pre>8   If the request can be honored, the signal function returns the value of func for the

<h3>7.16 [Variable arguments &lt;stdarg.h&gt;]</h3>
<a name='7.16p1'></a>
<pre>1   The header &lt;stdarg.h&gt; declares a type and defines four macros, for advancing
    through a list of arguments whose number and types are not known to the called function
    when it is translated.
</pre>
<a name='7.16p2'></a>
<pre>2   A function may be called with a variable number of arguments of varying types. As
    described in <a href='#6.9.1'>6.9.1</a>, its parameter list contains one or more parameters. The rightmost
    parameter plays a special role in the access mechanism, and will be designated parmN in
    this description.
</pre>
<a name='7.16p3'></a>
<pre>3   The type declared is
            va_list
    which is a complete object type suitable for holding information needed by the macros
    va_start, va_arg, va_end, and va_copy. If access to the varying arguments is
    desired, the called function shall declare an object (generally referred to as ap in this
    subclause) having type va_list. The object ap may be passed as an argument to
    another function; if that function invokes the va_arg macro with parameter ap, the
    value of ap in the calling function is indeterminate and shall be passed to the va_end
    macro prior to any further reference to ap.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.253'><sup>[253]</sup></a>

<a name='7.16.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   The va_start and va_arg macros described in this subclause shall be implemented
    as macros, not functions. It is unspecified whether va_copy and va_end are macros or
    identifiers declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to
    access an actual function, or a program defines an external identifier with the same name,
    the behavior is undefined. Each invocation of the va_start and va_copy macros
    shall be matched by a corresponding invocation of the va_end macro in the same
    function.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.16.1.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The va_arg macro expands to an expression that has the specified type and the value of
    the next argument in the call. The parameter ap shall have been initialized by the
    va_start or va_copy macro (without an intervening invocation of the va_end
    macro for the same ap). Each invocation of the va_arg macro modifies ap so that the
    values of successive arguments are returned in turn. The parameter type shall be a type
    name specified such that the type of a pointer to an object that has the specified type can
    be obtained simply by postfixing a * to type. If there is no actual next argument, or if
    type is not compatible with the type of the actual next argument (as promoted according
    to the default argument promotions), the behavior is undefined, except for the following
    cases:
    &mdash; one type is a signed integer type, the other type is the corresponding unsigned integer
      type, and the value is representable in both types;
    &mdash; one type is pointer to void and the other is a pointer to a character type.
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='7.16.1.1p3'></a>

    containing the expansion of the va_copy macro, that initialized the va_list ap. The
    va_end macro may modify ap so that it is no longer usable (without being reinitialized
    by the va_start or va_copy macro). If there is no corresponding invocation of the

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.17.2.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The atomic_init generic function initializes the atomic object pointed to by obj to
    the value value, while also initializing any additional state that the implementation
    might need to carry for the atomic object.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.2.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   Although this function initializes an atomic object, it does not avoid data races;
    concurrent access to the variable being initialized, even via an atomic operation,
    constitutes a data race.

<pre>2   For memory_order_relaxed, no operation orders memory.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p3'></a>
<pre>3   For       memory_order_release,       memory_order_acq_rel,             and
    memory_order_seq_cst, a store operation performs a release operation on the
    affected memory location.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p4'></a>
<pre>4   For       memory_order_acquire,       memory_order_acq_rel,             and
    memory_order_seq_cst, a load operation performs an acquire operation on the
    affected memory location.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p5'></a>
<pre>5   For memory_order_consume, a load operation performs a consume operation on the
    affected memory location.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p6'></a>
<pre>6   There shall be a single total order S on all memory_order_seq_cst operations,
    consistent with the &lsquo;&lsquo;happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; order and modification orders for all affected
    locations, such that each memory_order_seq_cst operation B that loads a value
    from an atomic object M observes one of the following values:
    &mdash; the result of the last modification A of M that precedes B in S, if it exists, or
    &mdash; if A exists, the result of some modification of M in the visible sequence of side
      effects with respect to B that is not memory_order_seq_cst and that does not
      happen before A, or
     &mdash; if A does not exist, the result of some modification of M in the visible sequence of
        side effects with respect to B that is not memory_order_seq_cst.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p7'></a>
<pre>7    NOTE 1 Although it is not explicitly required that S include lock operations, it can always be extended to
     an order that does include lock and unlock operations, since the ordering between those is already included
     in the &lsquo;&lsquo;happens before&rsquo;&rsquo; ordering.

</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p8'></a>
<pre>8    NOTE 2 Atomic operations specifying memory_order_relaxed are relaxed only with respect to
     memory ordering. Implementations must still guarantee that any given atomic access to a particular atomic
     object be indivisible with respect to all other atomic accesses to that object.

</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p9'></a>
<pre>9    For an atomic operation B that reads the value of an atomic object M, if there is a
     memory_order_seq_cst fence X sequenced before B, then B observes either the
     last memory_order_seq_cst modification of M preceding X in the total order S or
     a later modification of M in its modification order.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p10'></a>
<pre>10   For atomic operations A and B on an atomic object M, where A modifies M and B takes
     its value, if there is a memory_order_seq_cst fence X such that A is sequenced
     before X and B follows X in S, then B observes either the effects of A or a later
     modification of M in its modification order.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p11'></a>
<pre>11   For atomic operations A and B on an atomic object M, where A modifies M and B takes
     its value, if there are memory_order_seq_cst fences X and Y such that A is
     sequenced before X, Y is sequenced before B, and X precedes Y in S, then B observes
     either the effects of A or a later modification of M in its modification order.

<a name='7.17.3p12'></a>
<pre>12   Atomic read-modify-write operations shall always read the last value (in the modification
     order) stored before the write associated with the read-modify-write operation.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p13'></a>
<pre>13   An atomic store shall only store a value that has been computed from constants and
     program input values by a finite sequence of program evaluations, such that each
     evaluation observes the values of variables as computed by the last prior assignment in
     the sequence.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.256'><sup>[256]</sup></a> The ordering of evaluations in this sequence shall be such that
     &mdash; If an evaluation B observes a value computed by A in a different thread, then B does
       not happen before A.

<pre>14   NOTE 3 The second requirement disallows &lsquo;&lsquo;out-of-thin-air&rsquo;&rsquo;, or &lsquo;&lsquo;speculative&rsquo;&rsquo; stores of atomics when
     relaxed atomics are used. Since unordered operations are involved, evaluations may appear in this
     sequence out of thread order. For example, with x and y initially zero,
             // Thread 1:
             r1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, r1, memory_order_relaxed);

             // Thread 2:
             r2 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, 42, memory_order_relaxed);
     is allowed to produce r1 == 42 &amp;&amp; r2 == 42. The sequence of evaluations justifying this consists of:
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, 42, memory_order_relaxed);
             r1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, r1, memory_order_relaxed);
             r2 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
     On the other hand,
             // Thread 1:
             r1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, r1, memory_order_relaxed);

             // Thread 2:
             r2 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
             atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, r2, memory_order_relaxed);
     is not allowed to produce r1 == 42 &amp;&amp; r2 = 42, since there is no sequence of evaluations that results
     in the computation of 42. In the absence of &lsquo;&lsquo;relaxed&rsquo;&rsquo; operations and read-modify-write operations with
     weaker than memory_order_acq_rel ordering, the second requirement has no impact.

     Recommended practice
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p15'></a>
<pre>15   The requirements do not forbid r1 == 42 &amp;&amp; r2 == 42 in the following example,
     with x and y initially zero:
             // Thread 1:
             r1 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;x, memory_order_relaxed);
             if (r1 == 42)
                  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;y, r1, memory_order_relaxed);

             // Thread 2:
             r2 = atomic_load_explicit(&amp;y, memory_order_relaxed);
             if (r2 == 42)
                  atomic_store_explicit(&amp;x, 42, memory_order_relaxed);
     However, this is not useful behavior, and implementations should not allow it.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.3p16'></a>
<pre>16   Implementations should make atomic stores visible to atomic loads within a reasonable

<pre>3   A release fence A synchronizes with an atomic operation B that performs an acquire

<h3>7.17.5 [Lock-free property]</h3>
<a name='7.17.5p1'></a>
<pre>1   The atomic lock-free macros indicate the lock-free property of integer and address atomic

    the type is sometimes lock-free; a value of 2 indicates that the type is always lock-free.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.5p2'></a>
<pre>2   NOTE Operations that are lock-free should also be address-free. That is, atomic operations on the same
    memory location via two different addresses will communicate atomically. The implementation should not
    depend on any per-process state. This restriction enables communication via memory mapped into a

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.17.7.4p2'></a>
<pre>2   The failure argument shall not be memory_order_release nor
    memory_order_acq_rel. The failure argument shall be no stronger than the
    success argument. Atomically, compares the value pointed to by object for equality
    with that in expected, and if true, replaces the value pointed to by object with
    desired, and if false, updates the value in expected with the value pointed to by
    object. Further, if the comparison is true, memory is affected according to the value of
    success, and if the comparison is false, memory is affected according to the value of
    failure. These operations are atomic read-modify-write operations (<a href='#5.1.2.4'>5.1.2.4</a>).
</pre>
<a name='7.17.7.4p3'></a>
<pre>3   NOTE 1    For example, the effect of atomic_compare_exchange_strong is
             if (memcmp(object, expected, sizeof (*object)) == 0)
                   memcpy(object, &amp;desired, sizeof (*object));

                   memcpy(expected, object, sizeof (*object));

</pre>
<a name='7.17.7.4p4'></a>
<pre>4   A weak compare-and-exchange operation may fail spuriously. That is, even when the
    contents of memory referred to by expected and object are equal, it may return zero
    and store back to expected the same memory contents that were originally there.
</pre>
<a name='7.17.7.4p5'></a>
<pre>5   NOTE 2 This spurious failure enables implementation of compare-and-exchange on a broader class of
    machines, e.g. load-locked store-conditional machines.

</pre>
<a name='7.17.7.4p6'></a>
<pre>6   EXAMPLE         A consequence of spurious failure is that nearly all uses of weak compare-and-exchange will
    be in a loop.
             exp = atomic_load(&amp;cur);
             do {
                   des = function(exp);
             } while (!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(&amp;cur, &amp;exp, des));
    When a compare-and-exchange is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some
    platforms. When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not, the
    strong one is preferable.

<pre>4   The header &lt;wchar.h&gt; declares a number of functions useful for wide character input
    and output. The wide character input/output functions described in that subclause
    provide operations analogous to most of those described here, except that the
    fundamental units internal to the program are wide characters. The external
    representation (in the file) is a sequence of &lsquo;&lsquo;generalized&rsquo;&rsquo; multibyte characters, as

<h3>7.21.2 [Streams]</h3>
<a name='7.21.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as terminals and tape drives,
    or whether to or from files supported on structured storage devices, are mapped into
    logical data streams, whose properties are more uniform than their various inputs and
    outputs. Two forms of mapping are supported, for text streams and for binary
    streams.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.266'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.266'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 266)</b> An implementation need not distinguish between text streams and binary streams. In such an
         implementation, there need be no new-line characters in a text stream nor any limit to the length of a
         line.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   A text stream is an ordered sequence of characters composed into lines, each line
    consisting of zero or more characters plus a terminating new-line character. Whether the
    last line requires a terminating new-line character is implementation-defined. Characters
    may have to be added, altered, or deleted on input and output to conform to differing
    conventions for representing text in the host environment. Thus, there need not be a one-
    to-one correspondence between the characters in a stream and those in the external
    representation. Data read in from a text stream will necessarily compare equal to the data
    that were earlier written out to that stream only if: the data consist only of printing
    characters and the control characters horizontal tab and new-line; no new-line character is
    immediately preceded by space characters; and the last character is a new-line character.
    Whether space characters that are written out immediately before a new-line character
    appear when read in is implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   A binary stream is an ordered sequence of characters that can transparently record
    internal data. Data read in from a binary stream shall compare equal to the data that were
    earlier written out to that stream, under the same implementation. Such a stream may,
    however, have an implementation-defined number of null characters appended to the end
    of the stream.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   Each stream has an orientation. After a stream is associated with an external file, but
    before any operations are performed on it, the stream is without orientation. Once a wide
    character input/output function has been applied to a stream without orientation, the
    stream becomes a wide-oriented stream. Similarly, once a byte input/output function has
    been applied to a stream without orientation, the stream becomes a byte-oriented stream.
    Only a call to the freopen function or the fwide function can otherwise alter the
    orientation of a stream. (A successful call to freopen removes any orientation.)<a href='#FOOTNOTE.267'><sup>[267]</sup></a>

<pre><i><b>Footnote 267)</b> The three predefined streams stdin, stdout, and stderr are unoriented at program startup.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   Byte input/output functions shall not be applied to a wide-oriented stream and wide
    character input/output functions shall not be applied to a byte-oriented stream. The
    remaining stream operations do not affect, and are not affected by, a stream&rsquo;s orientation,
    except for the following additional restrictions:
    &mdash; Binary wide-oriented streams have the file-positioning restrictions ascribed to both
      text and binary streams.
    &mdash; For wide-oriented streams, after a successful call to a file-positioning function that
      leaves the file position indicator prior to the end-of-file, a wide character output
      function can overwrite a partial multibyte character; any file contents beyond the
      byte(s) written are henceforth indeterminate.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.2p6'></a>
<pre>6   Each wide-oriented stream has an associated mbstate_t object that stores the current
    parse state of the stream. A successful call to fgetpos stores a representation of the
    value of this mbstate_t object as part of the value of the fpos_t object. A later
    successful call to fsetpos using the same stored fpos_t value restores the value of
    the associated mbstate_t object as well as the position within the controlled stream.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.2p7'></a>
<pre>7   Each stream has an associated lock that is used to prevent data races when multiple
    threads of execution access a stream, and to restrict the interleaving of stream operations
    performed by multiple threads. Only one thread may hold this lock at a time. The lock is
    reentrant: a single thread may hold the lock multiple times at a given time.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.2p8'></a>
<pre>8   All functions that read, write, position, or query the position of a stream lock the stream
    before accessing it. They release the lock associated with the stream when the access is
    complete.

<h3>7.21.3 [Files]</h3>
<a name='7.21.3p1'></a>
<pre>1   A stream is associated with an external file (which may be a physical device) by opening
    a file, which may involve creating a new file. Creating an existing file causes its former
    contents to be discarded, if necessary. If a file can support positioning requests (such as a
    disk file, as opposed to a terminal), then a file position indicator associated with the
    stream is positioned at the start (character number zero) of the file, unless the file is
    opened with append mode in which case it is implementation-defined whether the file
    position indicator is initially positioned at the beginning or the end of the file. The file
    position indicator is maintained by subsequent reads, writes, and positioning requests, to
    facilitate an orderly progression through the file.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p2'></a>
<pre>2   Binary files are not truncated, except as defined in <a href='#7.21.5.3'>7.21.5.3</a>. Whether a write on a text
    stream causes the associated file to be truncated beyond that point is implementation-
    defined.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p3'></a>
<pre>3   When a stream is unbuffered, characters are intended to appear from the source or at the
    destination as soon as possible. Otherwise characters may be accumulated and
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block. When a stream is fully buffered,
    characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when
    a buffer is filled. When a stream is line buffered, characters are intended to be
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a new-line character is
    encountered. Furthermore, characters are intended to be transmitted as a block to the host
    environment when a buffer is filled, when input is requested on an unbuffered stream, or
    when input is requested on a line buffered stream that requires the transmission of
    characters from the host environment. Support for these characteristics is
    implementation-defined, and may be affected via the setbuf and setvbuf functions.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p4'></a>
<pre>4   A file may be disassociated from a controlling stream by closing the file. Output streams
    are flushed (any unwritten buffer contents are transmitted to the host environment) before
    the stream is disassociated from the file. The value of a pointer to a FILE object is
    indeterminate after the associated file is closed (including the standard text streams).
    Whether a file of zero length (on which no characters have been written by an output
    stream) actually exists is implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p5'></a>
<pre>5   The file may be subsequently reopened, by the same or another program execution, and
    its contents reclaimed or modified (if it can be repositioned at its start). If the main
    function returns to its original caller, or if the exit function is called, all open files are
    closed (hence all output streams are flushed) before program termination. Other paths to
    program termination, such as calling the abort function, need not close all files
    properly.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p6'></a>
<pre>6   The address of the FILE object used to control a stream may be significant; a copy of a
    FILE object need not serve in place of the original.
</pre>

<pre>7    At program startup, three text streams are predefined and need not be opened explicitly
     &mdash; standard input (for reading conventional input), standard output (for writing
     conventional output), and standard error (for writing diagnostic output). As initially
     opened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered; the standard input and standard
     output streams are fully buffered if and only if the stream can be determined not to refer
     to an interactive device.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p8'></a>
<pre>8    Functions that open additional (nontemporary) files require a file name, which is a string.
     The rules for composing valid file names are implementation-defined. Whether the same
     file can be simultaneously open multiple times is also implementation-defined.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p9'></a>
<pre>9    Although both text and binary wide-oriented streams are conceptually sequences of wide
     characters, the external file associated with a wide-oriented stream is a sequence of
     multibyte characters, generalized as follows:
     &mdash; Multibyte encodings within files may contain embedded null bytes (unlike multibyte
       encodings valid for use internal to the program).
     &mdash; A file need not begin nor end in the initial shift state.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.268'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.268'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 268)</b> Setting the file position indicator to end-of-file, as with fseek(file, 0, SEEK_END), has
          undefined behavior for a binary stream (because of possible trailing null characters) or for any stream
          with state-dependent encoding that does not assuredly end in the initial shift state.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.3p10'></a>

<a name='7.21.3p11'></a>
<pre>11   The wide character input functions read multibyte characters from the stream and convert
     them to wide characters as if they were read by successive calls to the fgetwc function.
     Each conversion occurs as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with the conversion state
     described by the stream&rsquo;s own mbstate_t object. The byte input functions read
     characters from the stream as if by successive calls to the fgetc function.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p12'></a>
<pre>12   The wide character output functions convert wide characters to multibyte characters and
     write them to the stream as if they were written by successive calls to the fputwc
     function. Each conversion occurs as if by a call to the wcrtomb function, with the
     conversion state described by the stream&rsquo;s own mbstate_t object. The byte output
     functions write characters to the stream as if by successive calls to the fputc function.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p13'></a>
<pre>13   In some cases, some of the byte input/output functions also perform conversions between
     multibyte characters and wide characters. These conversions also occur as if by calls to
     the mbrtowc and wcrtomb functions.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.3p14'></a>
<pre>14   An encoding error occurs if the character sequence presented to the underlying
     mbrtowc function does not form a valid (generalized) multibyte character, or if the code
     value passed to the underlying wcrtomb does not correspond to a valid (generalized)
     multibyte character. The wide character input/output functions and the byte input/output
     functions store the value of the macro EILSEQ in errno if and only if an encoding error
     occurs.

<pre>5   As noted above, a field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an asterisk. In
    this case, an int argument supplies the field width or precision. The arguments
    specifying field width, or precision, or both, shall appear (in that order) before the

<pre>6   The flag characters and their meanings are:
    -        The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
             this flag is not specified.)
    +        The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
             begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
             specified.)<a href='#FOOTNOTE.276'><sup>[276]</sup></a>
    space If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion
          results in no characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the space and + flags
          both appear, the space flag is ignored.
    #        The result is converted to an &lsquo;&lsquo;alternative form&rsquo;&rsquo;. For o conversion, it increases
             the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
             zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x (or X)
             conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g,
             and G conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
             contains a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a
             decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit
             follows it.) For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
             result. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
    0        For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, leading zeros
             (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather
             than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the
             0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X
              conversions, if a precision is specified, the 0 flag is ignored. For other
              conversions, the behavior is undefined.

<a name='7.21.6.1p8'></a>
<pre>8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i           The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [&minus;]dddd. The
                  precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
                  being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
                  leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
                  value with a precision of zero is no characters.
    o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
            decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd; the
            letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
            conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
            if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
            with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
            zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.
    f,F           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
                  decimal notation in the style [&minus;]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
                  the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification. If the
                  precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
                  not specified, no decimal-point character appears. If a decimal-point
                  character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is rounded to
                  the appropriate number of digits.
                  A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
                  [-]inf or [-]infinity &mdash; which style is implementation-defined. A
                  double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
                  [-]nan or [-]nan(n-char-sequence) &mdash; which style, and the meaning of
                  any n-char-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier
                  produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or nan,
                  respectively.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.277'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
    e,E           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
                  style [&minus;]d.ddd e&plusmn;dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
                  argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point character and the number of
                  digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as
              6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
              character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
              The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
              introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
              and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
              value is zero, the exponent is zero.
              A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
              of an f or F conversion specifier.
g,G           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
              style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
              depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
              precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
              Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X:
              &mdash; if P &gt; X &ge; &minus;4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
                P &minus; (X + 1).
              &mdash; otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P &minus; 1.
              Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the
              fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
              there is no fractional portion remaining.
              A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
              of an f or F conversion specifier.
a,A           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
              style [&minus;]0xh.hhhh p&plusmn;d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
              nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
              otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character<a href='#FOOTNOTE.278'><sup>[278]</sup></a> and the number
              of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is
              missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient for
              an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
              FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
              distinguish<a href='#FOOTNOTE.279'><sup>[279]</sup></a> values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
              omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
              point character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion and
              the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier produces a
              number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always contains at
              least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the
              decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.
              A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
              of an f or F conversion specifier.
c             If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an
              unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
              If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted as if by
              an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points
              to the initial element of a two-element array of wchar_t, the first element
              containing the wint_t argument to the lc conversion specification and the
              second a null wide character.
s             If no l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
              element of an array of character type.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.280'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Characters from the array are
              written up to (but not including) the terminating null character. If the
              precision is specified, no more than that many bytes are written. If the
              precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array shall
              contain a null character.
              If an l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
              element of an array of wchar_t type. Wide characters from the array are
              converted to multibyte characters (each as if by a call to the wcrtomb
              function, with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
              initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted) up to and
              including a terminating null wide character. The resulting multibyte
              characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character
              (byte). If no precision is specified, the array shall contain a null wide
              character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many bytes are
              written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array shall contain a null
              wide character if, to equal the multibyte character sequence length given by
                    the precision, the function would need to access a wide character one past the
                    end of the array. In no case is a partial multibyte character written.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.281'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
     p              The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of the pointer is
                    converted to a sequence of printing characters, in an implementation-defined
                    manner.
     n              The argument shall be a pointer to signed integer into which is written the
                    number of characters written to the output stream so far by this call to
                    fprintf. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion
                    specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the behavior is
                    undefined.

<h3>7.21.6.2 [The fscanf function]</h3>
<a name='7.21.6.2p1'></a>
<pre>1 Synopsis
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           int fscanf(FILE * restrict stream,
                const char * restrict format, ...);
    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The fscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under control
    of the string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input sequences and how
    they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments as pointers to the
    objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient arguments for the format,
    the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
    arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial
    shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space
    characters, an ordinary multibyte character (neither % nor a white-space character), or a
    conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
    After the %, the following appear in sequence:
    &mdash; An optional assignment-suppressing character *.
    &mdash; An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
      (in characters).
    &mdash; An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
    &mdash; A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   The fscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. When all directives
    have been executed, or if a directive fails (as detailed below), the function returns.
    Failures are described as input failures (due to the occurrence of an encoding error or the
    unavailability of input characters), or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   A directive composed of white-space character(s) is executed by reading input up to the
    first non-white-space character (which remains unread), or until no more characters can
    be read. The directive never fails.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p6'></a>
<pre>6   A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed by reading the next
    characters of the stream. If any of those characters differ from the ones composing the
    directive, the directive fails and the differing and subsequent characters remain unread.
    Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a character from being
    read, the directive fails.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p7'></a>
<pre>7   A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as
    described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the
     following steps:
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p8'></a>
<pre>8    Input white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function) are skipped, unless
     the specification includes a [, c, or n specifier.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.284'><sup>[284]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.284'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 284)</b> These white-space characters are not counted against a specified field width.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p9'></a>
<pre>9    An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an n specifier. An
     input item is defined as the longest sequence of input characters which does not exceed
     any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching input sequence.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.285'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
     The first character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input
     item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure unless
     end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the stream, in which
     case it is an input failure.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.285'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 285)</b> fscanf pushes back at most one input character onto the input stream. Therefore, some sequences
          that are acceptable to strtod, strtol, etc., are unacceptable to fscanf.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p10'></a>
<pre>10   Except in the case of a % specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a %n directive, the
     count of input characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion specifier. If
     the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails: this
     condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a *, the
     result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following
     the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this object
     does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented
     in the object, the behavior is undefined.

<pre>11   The length modifiers and their meanings are:
     hh             Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                    to an argument with type pointer to signed char or unsigned char.
     h              Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies

                    int.
     l (ell)        Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                    to an argument with type pointer to long int or unsigned long
                    int; that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier applies to
                    an argument with type pointer to double; or that a following c, s, or [
                    conversion specifier applies to an argument with type pointer to wchar_t.
     ll (ell-ell) Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                  to an argument with type pointer to long long int or unsigned
                  long long int.
     j           Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                 to an argument with type pointer to intmax_t or uintmax_t.
     z           Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                 to an argument with type pointer to size_t or the corresponding signed
                 integer type.
     t           Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies
                 to an argument with type pointer to ptrdiff_t or the corresponding
                 unsigned integer type.
     L           Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier
                 applies to an argument with type pointer to long double.
     If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above,
     the behavior is undefined.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p12'></a>
<pre>12   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
     d          Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as
                expected for the subject sequence of the strtol function with the value 10
                for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                signed integer.
     i          Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as expected
                for the subject sequence of the strtol function with the value 0 for the
                base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to signed
                integer.
     o          Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as
                expected for the subject sequence of the strtoul function with the value 8
                for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                unsigned integer.
     u          Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as
                expected for the subject sequence of the strtoul function with the value 10
                for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                unsigned integer.
     x          Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same
                as expected for the subject sequence of the strtoul function with the value
                16 for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                unsigned integer.
     a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose
             format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the strtod
             function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to floating.
c             Matches a sequence of characters of exactly the number specified by the field
              width (1 if no field width is present in the directive).<a href='#FOOTNOTE.286'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
              If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
              pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
              sequence. No null character is added.
              If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
              characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character in the
              sequence is converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc
              function, with the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object
              initialized to zero before the first multibyte character is converted. The
              corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
              wchar_t large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide characters.
              No null wide character is added.
s             Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.286'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
              If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
              pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
              sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
              If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
              characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is
              converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with
              the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
              before the first multibyte character is converted. The corresponding argument
              shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough
              to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be
              added automatically.
[             Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from a set of expected characters
              (the scanset).<a href='#FOOTNOTE.286'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
              If no l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
              pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to accept the
              sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.
              If an l length modifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of multibyte
              characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each multibyte character is
              converted to a wide character as if by a call to the mbrtowc function, with
              the conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
                    before the first multibyte character is converted. The corresponding argument
                    shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough
                    to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be
                    added automatically.
                    The conversion specifier includes all subsequent characters in the format
                    string, up to and including the matching right bracket (]). The characters
                    between the brackets (the scanlist) compose the scanset, unless the character
                    after the left bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the scanset contains all
                    characters that do not appear in the scanlist between the circumflex and the
                    right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with [] or [^], the right
                    bracket character is in the scanlist and the next following right bracket
                    character is the matching right bracket that ends the specification; otherwise
                    the first following right bracket character is the one that ends the
                    specification. If a - character is in the scanlist and is not the first, nor the
                    second where the first character is a ^, nor the last character, the behavior is
                    implementation-defined.
     p              Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
                    same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
                    the fprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
                    pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
                    implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
                    during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
                    equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.
     n              No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                    signed integer into which is to be written the number of characters read from
                    the input stream so far by this call to the fscanf function. Execution of a
                    %n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
                    completion of execution of the fscanf function. No argument is converted,
                    but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignment-
                    suppressing character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.
     %              Matches a single % character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
                    complete conversion specification shall be %%.

     the first of which is denoted here by a and the second by an uppercase letter, but are only recognized as
     such when in the alternate shift state. The shift sequences are denoted by &uarr; and &darr;, in which the first causes
     entry into the alternate shift state.

               char str[50];
               fscanf(stdin, &quot;a%s&quot;, str);
     with the input line:
               a&uarr; X Y&darr; bc
     str will contain &uarr; X Y&darr;\0 assuming that none of the bytes of the shift sequences (or of the multibyte
     characters, in the more general case) appears to be a single-byte white-space character.
</pre>

             wchar_t wstr[50];
             fscanf(stdin, &quot;a%ls&quot;, wstr);
     with the same input line, wstr will contain the two wide characters that correspond to X and Y and a
     terminating null wide character.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p26'></a>
<pre>26   However, the call:

             /* ... */
             wchar_t wstr[50];
             fscanf(stdin, &quot;a&uarr; X&darr;%ls&quot;, wstr);
     with the same input line will return zero due to a matching failure against the &darr; sequence in the format
     string.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.6.2p27'></a>
<pre>27   Assuming that the first byte of the multibyte character X is the same as the first byte of the multibyte
     character Y, after the call:
             #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             #include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

             wchar_t wstr[50];
             fscanf(stdin, &quot;a&uarr; Y&darr;%ls&quot;, wstr);
     with the same input line, zero will again be returned, but stdin will be left with a partially consumed
     multibyte character.

<pre>2   The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is written into
    an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream. If n is zero, nothing is written,
    and s may be a null pointer. Otherwise, output characters beyond the n-1st are
    discarded rather than being written to the array, and a null character is written at the end
    of the characters actually written into the array. If copying takes place between objects
    that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.21.7.10p2'></a>
<pre>2   The ungetc function pushes the character specified by c (converted to an unsigned
    char) back onto the input stream pointed to by stream. Pushed-back characters will be
    returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A
    successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a file positioning
    function (fseek, fsetpos, or rewind) discards any pushed-back characters for the
    stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.7.10p3'></a>
<pre>3   One character of pushback is guaranteed. If the ungetc function is called too many
    times on the same stream without an intervening read or file positioning operation on that
    stream, the operation may fail.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.7.10p4'></a>
<pre>4   If the value of c equals that of the macro EOF, the operation fails and the input stream is
    unchanged.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.7.10p5'></a>
<pre>5   A successful call to the ungetc function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream.
    The value of the file position indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all
    pushed-back characters shall be the same as it was before the characters were pushed
    back. For a text stream, the value of its file position indicator after a successful call to the
    ungetc function is unspecified until all pushed-back characters are read or discarded.
    For a binary stream, its file position indicator is decremented by each successful call to
    the ungetc function; if its value was zero before a call, it is indeterminate after the
    call.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.290'><sup>[290]</sup></a>

<pre>2   The fread function reads, into the array pointed to by ptr, up to nmemb elements
    whose size is specified by size, from the stream pointed to by stream. For each
    object, size calls are made to the fgetc function and the results stored, in the order

</pre>
<a name='7.21.9.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   For a binary stream, the new position, measured in characters from the beginning of the
    file, is obtained by adding offset to the position specified by whence. The specified
    position is the beginning of the file if whence is SEEK_SET, the current value of the file
    position indicator if SEEK_CUR, or end-of-file if SEEK_END. A binary stream need not
    meaningfully support fseek calls with a whence value of SEEK_END.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.9.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   For a text stream, either offset shall be zero, or offset shall be a value returned by

    and whence shall be SEEK_SET.
</pre>
<a name='7.21.9.2p5'></a>

<pre>2   The strtod, strtof, and strtold functions convert the initial portion of the string
    pointed to by nptr to double, float, and long double representation,
    respectively. First, they decompose the input string into three parts: an initial, possibly
    empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by the isspace function), a
    subject sequence resembling a floating-point constant or representing an infinity or NaN;
    and a final string of one or more unrecognized characters, including the terminating null
    character of the input string. Then, they attempt to convert the subject sequence to a
    floating-point number, and return the result.
</pre>
<a name='7.22.1.3p3'></a>
<pre>3   The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional plus or minus sign, then one of
    the following:
    &mdash; a nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing a decimal-point
      character, then an optional exponent part as defined in <a href='#6.4.4.2'>6.4.4.2</a>;
    &mdash; a 0x or 0X, then a nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing a
      decimal-point character, then an optional binary exponent part as defined in <a href='#6.4.4.2'>6.4.4.2</a>;
    &mdash; INF or INFINITY, ignoring case
    &mdash; NAN or NAN(n-char-sequenceopt), ignoring case in the NAN part, where:
               n-char-sequence:
                      digit
                      nondigit
                      n-char-sequence digit
                      n-char-sequence nondigit
    The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the input string,
    starting with the first non-white-space character, that is of the expected form. The subject
    sequence contains no characters if the input string is not of the expected form.
</pre>
<a name='7.22.1.3p4'></a>
<pre>4   If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-point number, the sequence of
    characters starting with the first digit or the decimal-point character (whichever occurs
    first) is interpreted as a floating constant according to the rules of <a href='#6.4.4.2'>6.4.4.2</a>, except that the
    decimal-point character is used in place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part
    nor a decimal-point character appears in a decimal floating point number, or if a binary
    exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal floating point number, an exponent part
    of the appropriate type with value zero is assumed to follow the last digit in the string. If
    the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the sequence is interpreted as negated.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.292'><sup>[292]</sup></a>
    A character sequence INF or INFINITY is interpreted as an infinity, if representable in
    the return type, else like a floating constant that is too large for the range of the return
    type. A character sequence NAN or NAN(n-char-sequenceopt) is interpreted as a quiet
    NaN, if supported in the return type, else like a subject sequence part that does not have
    the expected form; the meaning of the n-char sequence is implementation-defined.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.293'><sup>[293]</sup></a> A

    not including an integer suffix. If the value of base is between 2 and 36 (inclusive), the

    integer with the radix specified by base, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign,
    but not including an integer suffix. The letters from a (or A) through z (or Z) are
    ascribed the values 10 through 35; only letters and digits whose ascribed values are less

<pre>1   The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to the
    aligned_alloc, calloc, malloc, and realloc functions is unspecified. The
    pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to
    a pointer to any type of object with a fundamental alignment requirement and then used
    to access such an object or an array of such objects in the space allocated (until the space
    is explicitly deallocated). The lifetime of an allocated object extends from the allocation
    until the deallocation. Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object disjoint from
    any other object. The pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the
    allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer is returned. If the size of
    the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer
    is returned, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, except that the
    returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.
</pre>
<a name='7.22.3p2'></a>
<pre>2   For purposes of determining the existence of a data race, memory allocation functions
    behave as though they accessed only memory locations accessible through their
    arguments and not other static duration storage. These functions may, however, visibly
    modify the storage that they allocate or deallocate. A call to free or realloc that
    deallocates a region p of memory synchronizes with any allocation call that allocates all
    or part of the region p. This synchronization occurs after any access of p by the
    deallocating function, and before any such access by the allocating function.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.22.8.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The wcstombs function converts a sequence of wide characters from the array pointed
    to by pwcs into a sequence of corresponding multibyte characters that begins in the
    initial shift state, and stores these multibyte characters into the array pointed to by s,
    stopping if a multibyte character would exceed the limit of n total bytes or if a null
    character is stored. Each wide character is converted as if by a call to the wctomb
    function, except that the conversion state of the wctomb function is not affected.
</pre>
<a name='7.22.8.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   No more than n bytes will be modified in the array pointed to by s. If copying takes place

<pre>4   If a wide character is encountered that does not correspond to a valid multibyte character,

<a name='7.25p2'></a>
<pre>2   Of the &lt;math.h&gt; and &lt;complex.h&gt; functions without an f (float) or l (long

    double. For each such function, except modf, there is a corresponding type-generic
    macro.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.313'><sup>[313]</sup></a> The parameters whose corresponding real type is double in the function
    synopsis are generic parameters. Use of the macro invokes a function whose
    corresponding real type and type domain are determined by the arguments for the generic
    parameters.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.314'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.313'>

    &mdash; First, if any argument for generic parameters has type long double, the type
      determined is long double.

    which is a complete object type that holds an identifier for a mutex;
             tss_dtor_t
    which is the function pointer type void (*)(void*), used for a destructor for a
    thread-specific storage pointer;
           thrd_start_t
    which is the function pointer type int (*)(void*) that is passed to thrd_create

<pre>2   The mktime function converts the broken-down time, expressed as local time, in the
    structure pointed to by timeptr into a calendar time value with the same encoding as
    that of the values returned by the time function. The original values of the tm_wday
    and tm_yday components of the structure are ignored, and the original values of the
    other components are not restricted to the ranges indicated above.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.320'><sup>[320]</sup></a> On successful
    completion, the values of the tm_wday and tm_yday components of the structure are

<a name='7.28p1'></a>
<pre>1   The header &lt;uchar.h&gt; declares types and functions for manipulating Unicode
    characters.
</pre>
<a name='7.28p2'></a>
<pre>2   The types declared are mbstate_t (described in <a href='#7.30.1'>7.30.1</a>) and size_t (described in
    <a href='#7.19'>7.19</a>);
           char16_t
    which is an unsigned integer type used for 16-bit characters and is the same type as
    uint_least16_t (described in <a href='#7.20.1.2'>7.20.1.2</a>); and
           char32_t
    which is an unsigned integer type used for 32-bit characters and is the same type as

<h3>7.28.1 [Restartable multibyte/wide character conversion functions]</h3>
<a name='7.28.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   These functions have a parameter, ps, of type pointer to mbstate_t that points to an
    object that can completely describe the current conversion state of the associated
    multibyte character sequence, which the functions alter as necessary. If ps is a null
    pointer, each function uses its own internal mbstate_t object instead, which is
    initialized at program startup to the initial conversion state; the functions are not required
    to avoid data races with other calls to the same function in this case. The implementation
    behaves as if no library function calls these functions with a null pointer for ps.

<h3>7.28.1.1 [The mbrtoc16 function]</h3>
<a name='7.28.1.1p1'></a>
<pre>1 Synopsis
          #include &lt;uchar.h&gt;
           size_t mbrtoc16(char16_t * restrict pc16,
                const char * restrict s, size_t n,
                mbstate_t * restrict ps);
    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   If s is a null pointer, the mbrtoc16 function is equivalent to the call:
                   mbrtoc16(NULL, &quot;&quot;, 1, ps)
    In this case, the values of the parameters pc16 and n are ignored.
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   If s is not a null pointer, the mbrtoc16 function inspects at most n bytes beginning with
    the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes needed to complete the next
    multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the
    next multibyte character is complete and valid, it determines the values of the
    corresponding wide characters and then, if pc16 is not a null pointer, stores the value of
    the first (or only) such character in the object pointed to by pc16. Subsequent calls will
    store successive wide characters without consuming any additional input until all the
    characters have been stored. If the corresponding wide character is the null wide
    character, the resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   The mbrtoc16 function returns the first of the following that applies (given the current
    conversion state):
    0                     if the next n or fewer bytes complete the multibyte character that
                          corresponds to the null wide character (which is the value stored).
    between 1 and n inclusive if the next n or fewer bytes complete a valid multibyte
                       character (which is the value stored); the value returned is the number
                       of bytes that complete the multibyte character.
    (size_t)(-3) if the next character resulting from a previous call has been stored (no
                 bytes from the input have been consumed by this call).
    (size_t)(-2) if the next n bytes contribute to an incomplete (but potentially valid)
                 multibyte character, and all n bytes have been processed (no value is
                 stored).<a href='#FOOTNOTE.324'><sup>[324]</sup></a>

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   If s is a null pointer, the c16rtomb function is equivalent to the call

    where buf is an internal buffer.
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   If s is not a null pointer, the c16rtomb function determines the number of bytes needed
    to represent the multibyte character that corresponds to the wide character given by c16
    (including any shift sequences), and stores the multibyte character representation in the
    array whose first element is pointed to by s. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes are stored. If
    c16 is a null wide character, a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift sequence needed
    to restore the initial shift state; the resulting state described is the initial conversion state.
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   The c16rtomb function returns the number of bytes stored in the array object (including
    any shift sequences). When c16 is not a valid wide character, an encoding error occurs:

    In this case, the values of the parameters pc32 and n are ignored.
</pre>
<a name='7.28.1.3p3'></a>
<pre>3   If s is not a null pointer, the mbrtoc32 function inspects at most n bytes beginning with
    the byte pointed to by s to determine the number of bytes needed to complete the next
    multibyte character (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the
    next multibyte character is complete and valid, it determines the values of the

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The fwprintf function writes output to the stream pointed to by stream, under
    control of the wide string pointed to by format that specifies how subsequent arguments
    are converted for output. If there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behavior
    is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments
    are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored. The fwprintf function returns
    when the end of the format string is encountered.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   The format is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary wide characters (not %),
    which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of
    which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments, converting them, if
    applicable, according to the corresponding conversion specifier, and then writing the

    &mdash; Zero or more flags (in any order) that modify the meaning of the conversion
      specification.
    &mdash; An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer wide characters
      than the field width, it is padded with spaces (by default) on the left (or right, if the
      left adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the field width. The field
      width takes the form of an asterisk * (described later) or a nonnegative decimal
      integer.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.330'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
    &mdash; An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the d, i,

      wide character for a, A, e, E, f, and F conversions, the maximum number of
      significant digits for the g and G conversions, or the maximum number of wide
      characters to be written for s conversions. The precision takes the form of a period
      (.) followed either by an asterisk * (described later) or by an optional decimal
      integer; if only the period is specified, the precision is taken as zero. If a precision
      appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined.

    precision were omitted.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   The flag wide characters and their meanings are:
    -        The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
             this flag is not specified.)
    +        The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
             begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not
              specified.)<a href='#FOOTNOTE.331'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
    space If the first wide character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed
          conversion results in no wide characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the
          space and + flags both appear, the space flag is ignored.
    #         The result is converted to an &lsquo;&lsquo;alternative form&rsquo;&rsquo;. For o conversion, it increases
              the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
              zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x (or X)
              conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g,
              and G conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
              contains a decimal-point wide character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a
              decimal-point wide character appears in the result of these conversions only if a
              digit follows it.) For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the
              result. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
    0         For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, leading zeros
              (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather
              than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the
              0 and - flags both appear, the 0 flag is ignored. For d, i, o, u, x, and X
              conversions, if a precision is specified, the 0 flag is ignored. For other

                 specifier applies to a pointer to an intmax_t argument.
    z            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion specifier applies to a
                 size_t or the corresponding signed integer type argument; or that a
                 following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a signed integer type

                 following n conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a ptrdiff_t
                 argument.
    L            Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier

<pre>8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i         The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [&minus;]dddd. The
                precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
                being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
                leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
                value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.
    o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
            decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd; the
            letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
            conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
            if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
            with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
            zero value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.
f,F          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
             decimal notation in the style [&minus;]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
             the decimal-point wide character is equal to the precision specification. If the
             precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
             not specified, no decimal-point wide character appears. If a decimal-point
             wide character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is
             rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
             A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
             [-]inf or [-]infinity &mdash; which style is implementation-defined. A
             double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
             [-]nan or [-]nan(n-wchar-sequence) &mdash; which style, and the meaning of
             any n-wchar-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion
             specifier produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or
             nan, respectively.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.332'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
e,E          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
             style [&minus;]d.ddd e&plusmn;dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
             argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point wide character and the number
             of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken
             as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
             wide character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of
             digits. The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
             introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
             and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
             value is zero, the exponent is zero.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
g,G          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
             style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
             depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
             precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
             Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X:
             &mdash; if P &gt; X &ge; &minus;4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
               P &minus; (X + 1).
             &mdash; otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P &minus; 1.
             Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the
             fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point wide character is
             removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
a,A          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
             style [&minus;]0xh.hhhh p&plusmn;d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
             nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
             otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point wide character<a href='#FOOTNOTE.333'><sup>[333]</sup></a> and the
             number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision
             is missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient
             for an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
             FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
             distinguish<a href='#FOOTNOTE.334'><sup>[334]</sup></a> values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
             omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
             point wide character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion
             and the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier
             produces a number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always
             contains at least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to
             represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is
             zero.
             A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
             of an f or F conversion specifier.
c            If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to a wide
             character as if by calling btowc and the resulting wide character is written.
             If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted to
             wchar_t and written.
s            If no l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
             element of a character array containing a multibyte character sequence
             beginning in the initial shift state. Characters from the array are converted as
             if by repeated calls to the mbrtowc function, with the conversion state
             described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first
             multibyte character is converted, and written up to (but not including) the
                    terminating null wide character. If the precision is specified, no more than
                    that many wide characters are written. If the precision is not specified or is
                    greater than the size of the converted array, the converted array shall contain a
                    null wide character.
                    If an l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
                    element of an array of wchar_t type. Wide characters from the array are
                    written up to (but not including) a terminating null wide character. If the
                    precision is specified, no more than that many wide characters are written. If
                    the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array
                    shall contain a null wide character.
     p              The argument shall be a pointer to void. The value of the pointer is
                    converted to a sequence of printing wide characters, in an implementation-
                    defined manner.
     n              The argument shall be a pointer to signed integer into which is written the
                    number of wide characters written to the output stream so far by this call to
                    fwprintf. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the
                    conversion specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the
                    behavior is undefined.
     %              A % wide character is written. No argument is converted. The complete
                    conversion specification shall be %%.

<pre>1 Synopsis
            #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;
             int fwscanf(FILE * restrict stream,
                  const wchar_t * restrict format, ...);
     Description
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p2'></a>
<pre>2    The fwscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under
     control of the wide string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input
     sequences and how they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments
    as pointers to the objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient
    arguments for the format, the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while
    arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise
    ignored.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space wide
    characters, an ordinary wide character (neither % nor a white-space wide character), or a
    conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the wide
    character %. After the %, the following appear in sequence:
    &mdash; An optional assignment-suppressing wide character *.
    &mdash; An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
      (in wide characters).
    &mdash; An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
    &mdash; A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type of conversion to be
      applied.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   The fwscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. When all directives
    have been executed, or if a directive fails (as detailed below), the function returns.
    Failures are described as input failures (due to the occurrence of an encoding error or the
    unavailability of input characters), or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p5'></a>
<pre>5   A directive composed of white-space wide character(s) is executed by reading input up to
    the first non-white-space wide character (which remains unread), or until no more wide
    characters can be read. The directive never fails.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p6'></a>
<pre>6   A directive that is an ordinary wide character is executed by reading the next wide
    character of the stream. If that wide character differs from the directive, the directive
    fails and the differing and subsequent wide characters remain unread. Similarly, if end-
    of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a wide character from being read, the
    directive fails.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p7'></a>
<pre>7   A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as
    described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the
    following steps:
</pre>
<a name='7.29.2.2p8'></a>
<pre>8   Input white-space wide characters (as specified by the iswspace function) are skipped,
    unless the specification includes a [, c, or n specifier.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.337'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.337'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 337)</b> These white-space wide characters are not counted against a specified field width.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.29.2.2p9'></a>
<pre>9   An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an n specifier. An
    input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide characters which does not
    exceed any specified field width and which is, or is a prefix of, a matching input
     sequence.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.338'><sup>[338]</sup></a> The first wide character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the
     length of the input item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a
     matching failure unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input
     from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.338'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 338)</b> fwscanf pushes back at most one input wide character onto the input stream. Therefore, some
          sequences that are acceptable to wcstod, wcstol, etc., are unacceptable to fwscanf.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.29.2.2p10'></a>
<pre>10   Except in the case of a % specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a %n directive, the
     count of input wide characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion
     specifier. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails:
     this condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a *,
     the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument
     following the format argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this
     object does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be
     represented in the object, the behavior is undefined.

                  int; that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier applies to

                  integer type.
     t            Specifies that a following d, i, o, u, x, X, or n conversion specifier applies

                  unsigned integer type.
     L           Specifies that a following a, A, e, E, f, F, g, or G conversion specifier
                 applies to an argument with type pointer to long double.
     If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above,

<pre>12   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
     d          Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as

                as expected for the subject sequence of the wcstoul function with the value
                16 for the base argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                unsigned integer.
     a,e,f,g Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose
             format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the wcstod
             function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to floating.
     c          Matches a sequence of wide characters of exactly the number specified by the
                field width (1 if no field width is present in the directive).
                If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
                converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
                conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
                before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
                shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
                accept the sequence. No null character is added.
                If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
    pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
    the sequence. No null wide character is added.
s   Matches a sequence of non-white-space wide characters.
    If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
    converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
    conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
    before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
    shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
    accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added
    automatically.
    If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
    pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
    the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be added
    automatically.
[   Matches a nonempty sequence of wide characters from a set of expected
    characters (the scanset).
    If no l length modifier is present, characters from the input field are
    converted as if by repeated calls to the wcrtomb function, with the
    conversion state described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero
    before the first wide character is converted. The corresponding argument
    shall be a pointer to the initial element of a character array large enough to
    accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added
    automatically.
    If an l length modifier is present, the corresponding argument shall be a
    pointer to the initial element of an array of wchar_t large enough to accept
    the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which will be added
    automatically.
    The conversion specifier includes all subsequent wide characters in the
    format string, up to and including the matching right bracket (]). The wide
    characters between the brackets (the scanlist) compose the scanset, unless the
    wide character after the left bracket is a circumflex (^), in which case the
    scanset contains all wide characters that do not appear in the scanlist between
    the circumflex and the right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with
    [] or [^], the right bracket wide character is in the scanlist and the next
    following right bracket wide character is the matching right bracket that ends
    the specification; otherwise the first following right bracket wide character is
    the one that ends the specification. If a - wide character is in the scanlist and
    is not the first, nor the second where the first wide character is a ^, nor the
                    last character, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     p              Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
                    same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
                    the fwprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
                    pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
                    implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
                    during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
                    equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.
     n              No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                    signed integer into which is to be written the number of wide characters read
                    from the input stream so far by this call to the fwscanf function. Execution
                    of a %n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
                    completion of execution of the fwscanf function. No argument is
                    converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an
                    assignment-suppressing wide character or a field width, the behavior is
                    undefined.
     %              Matches a single % wide character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
                    complete conversion specification shall be %%.

    infinity or NaN; and a final wide string of one or more unrecognized wide characters,

    if neither an exponent part nor a decimal-point wide character appears in a decimal
    floating point number, or if a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal
    floating point number, an exponent part of the appropriate type with value zero is

    sign, the sequence is interpreted as negated.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.343'><sup>[343]</sup></a> A wide character sequence INF or
    INFINITY is interpreted as an infinity, if representable in the return type, else like a

    Description
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p2'></a>
<pre>2   A sequence of calls to the wcstok function breaks the wide string pointed to by s1 into
    a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a wide character from the wide string
    pointed to by s2. The third argument points to a caller-provided wchar_t pointer into
    which the wcstok function stores information necessary for it to continue scanning the
    same wide string.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p3'></a>
<pre>3   The first call in a sequence has a non-null first argument and stores an initial value in the
    object pointed to by ptr. Subsequent calls in the sequence have a null first argument and
    the object pointed to by ptr is required to have the value stored by the previous call in
    the sequence, which is then updated. The separator wide string pointed to by s2 may be
    different from call to call.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p4'></a>
<pre>4   The first call in the sequence searches the wide string pointed to by s1 for the first wide
    character that is not contained in the current separator wide string pointed to by s2. If no
    such wide character is found, then there are no tokens in the wide string pointed to by s1
    and the wcstok function returns a null pointer. If such a wide character is found, it is
    the start of the first token.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p5'></a>
<pre>5   The wcstok function then searches from there for a wide character that is contained in
    the current separator wide string. If no such wide character is found, the current token
    extends to the end of the wide string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches in the
    same wide string for a token return a null pointer. If such a wide character is found, it is
    overwritten by a null wide character, which terminates the current token.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p6'></a>
<pre>6   In all cases, the wcstok function stores sufficient information in the pointer pointed to
    by ptr so that subsequent calls, with a null pointer for s1 and the unmodified pointer
    value for ptr, shall start searching just past the element overwritten by a null wide
    character (if any).
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='7.29.4.5.7p7'></a>

<pre>2   The wcsftime function is equivalent to the strftime function, except that:
    &mdash; The argument s points to the initial element of an array of wide characters into which
      the generated output is to be placed.
    &mdash; The argument maxsize indicates the limiting number of wide characters.
    &mdash; The argument format is a wide string and the conversion specifiers are replaced by
      corresponding sequences of wide characters.

<h3>7.29.6 [Extended multibyte/wide character conversion utilities]</h3>
<a name='7.29.6p1'></a>
<pre>1   The header &lt;wchar.h&gt; declares an extended set of functions useful for conversion
    between multibyte characters and wide characters.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.6p2'></a>
<pre>2   Most of the following functions &mdash; those that are listed as &lsquo;&lsquo;restartable&rsquo;&rsquo;, <a href='#7.29.6.3'>7.29.6.3</a> and
    <a href='#7.29.6.4'>7.29.6.4</a> &mdash; take as a last argument a pointer to an object of type mbstate_t that is used
    to describe the current conversion state from a particular multibyte character sequence to
    a wide character sequence (or the reverse) under the rules of a particular setting for the
    LC_CTYPE category of the current locale.
</pre>
<a name='7.29.6p3'></a>
<pre>3   The initial conversion state corresponds, for a conversion in either direction, to the
    beginning of a new multibyte character in the initial shift state. A zero-valued
    mbstate_t object is (at least) one way to describe an initial conversion state. A zero-
    valued mbstate_t object can be used to initiate conversion involving any multibyte
    character sequence, in any LC_CTYPE category setting. If an mbstate_t object has
    been altered by any of the functions described in this subclause, and is then used with a
    different multibyte character sequence, or in the other conversion direction, or with a
    different LC_CTYPE category setting than on earlier function calls, the behavior is
    undefined.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.348'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.348'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 348)</b> Thus, a particular mbstate_t object can be used, for example, with both the mbrtowc and
         mbsrtowcs functions as long as they are used to step sequentially through the same multibyte
         character string.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.29.6p4'></a>
<pre>4   On entry, each function takes the described conversion state (either internal or pointed to
    by an argument) as current. The conversion state described by the referenced object is
    altered as needed to track the shift state, and the position within a multibyte character, for
    the associated multibyte character sequence.

<h3>F.1 [Introduction]</h3>
<a name='F.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   This annex specifies C language support for the IEC 60559 floating-point standard. The
    IEC 60559 floating-point standard is specifically Binary floating-point arithmetic for
    microprocessor systems, second edition (IEC 60559:1989), previously designated
    IEC 559:1989 and as IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic
    (ANSI/IEEE 754&minus;1985). IEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point
    Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE 854&minus;1987) generalizes the binary standard to remove
    dependencies on radix and word length. IEC 60559 generally refers to the floating-point
    standard, as in IEC 60559 operation, IEC 60559 format, etc. An implementation that
    defines _ _STDC_IEC_559_ _ shall conform to the specifications in this annex.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.356'><sup>[356]</sup></a>
    Where a binding between the C language and IEC 60559 is indicated, the
    IEC 60559-specified behavior is adopted by reference, unless stated otherwise. Since
    negative and positive infinity are representable in IEC 60559 formats, all real numbers lie
    within the range of representable values.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.356'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 356)</b> Implementations that do not define _ _STDC_IEC_559_ _ are not required to conform to these

<h3>F.2 [Types]</h3>
<a name='F.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The C floating types match the IEC 60559 formats as follows:
    &mdash; The float type matches the IEC 60559 single format.
    &mdash; The double type matches the IEC 60559 double format.
    &mdash; The long double type matches an IEC 60559 extended format,<a href='#FOOTNOTE.357'><sup>[357]</sup></a> else a
      non-IEC 60559 extended format, else the IEC 60559 double format.
    Any non-IEC 60559 extended format used for the long double type shall have more
    precision than IEC 60559 double and at least the range of IEC 60559 double.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.358'><sup>[358]</sup></a>
    Recommended practice
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.357'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 357)</b> &lsquo;&lsquo;Extended&rsquo;&rsquo; is IEC 60559&rsquo;s double-extended data format. Extended refers to both the common 80-bit
         and quadruple 128-bit IEC 60559 formats.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.358'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 358)</b> A non-IEC 60559 long double type is required to provide infinity and NaNs, as its values include
         all double values.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='F.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The long double type should match an IEC 60559 extended format.

<h3>F.2.1 [Infinities, signed zeros, and NaNs]</h3>
<a name='F.2.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   This specification does not define the behavior of signaling NaNs.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.359'><sup>[359]</sup></a> It generally uses
    the term NaN to denote quiet NaNs. The NAN and INFINITY macros and the nan
    functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide designations for IEC 60559 NaNs and infinities.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.359'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 359)</b> Since NaNs created by IEC 60559 operations are always quiet, quiet NaNs (along with infinities) are
         sufficient for closure of the arithmetic.

    listed below.
    &mdash; The +, &minus;, *, and / operators provide the IEC 60559 add, subtract, multiply, and
      divide operations.
    &mdash; The sqrt functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 square root operation.
    &mdash; The remainder functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 remainder
      operation. The remquo functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the same operation but
      with additional information.
    &mdash; The rint functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 operation that rounds a
      floating-point number to an integer value (in the same precision). The nearbyint
      functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the nearbyinteger function recommended in the
      Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.
    &mdash; The conversions for floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions between
      floating-point precisions.
    &mdash; The conversions from integer to floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions
      from integer to floating point.
    &mdash; The conversions from floating to integer types provide IEC 60559-like conversions
      but always round toward zero.
    &mdash; The lrint and llrint functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559
      conversions, which honor the directed rounding mode, from floating point to the
      long int and long long int integer formats. The lrint and llrint
      functions can be used to implement IEC 60559 conversions from floating to other
      integer formats.
    &mdash; The translation time conversion of floating constants and the strtod, strtof,
      strtold, fprintf, fscanf, and related library functions in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;,
   &lt;stdio.h&gt;, and &lt;wchar.h&gt; provide IEC 60559 binary-decimal conversions. The
   strtold function in &lt;stdlib.h&gt; provides the conv function recommended in the
   Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.
&mdash; The relational and equality operators provide IEC 60559 comparisons. IEC 60559
  identifies a need for additional comparison predicates to facilitate writing code that
  accounts for NaNs. The comparison macros (isgreater, isgreaterequal,
  isless, islessequal, islessgreater, and isunordered) in &lt;math.h&gt;
  supplement the language operators to address this need. The islessgreater and
  isunordered macros provide respectively a quiet version of the &lt;&gt; predicate and
  the unordered predicate recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
&mdash; The feclearexcept, feraiseexcept, and fetestexcept functions in
  &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility to test and alter the IEC 60559 floating-point
  exception status flags. The fegetexceptflag and fesetexceptflag
  functions in &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility to save and restore all five status flags at
  one time. These functions are used in conjunction with the type fexcept_t and the
  floating-point    exception      macros      (FE_INEXACT,         FE_DIVBYZERO,
  FE_UNDERFLOW, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_INVALID) also in &lt;fenv.h&gt;.
&mdash; The fegetround and fesetround functions in &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility
  to select among the IEC 60559 directed rounding modes represented by the rounding
  direction macros in &lt;fenv.h&gt; (FE_TONEAREST, FE_UPWARD, FE_DOWNWARD,
  FE_TOWARDZERO) and the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 of FLT_ROUNDS are the
  IEC 60559 directed rounding modes.
&mdash; The fegetenv, feholdexcept, fesetenv, and feupdateenv functions in
  &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide a facility to manage the floating-point environment, comprising
  the IEC 60559 status flags and control modes.
&mdash; The copysign functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the copysign function
  recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
&mdash; The fabs functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the abs function recommended in the
  Appendix to IEC 60559.
&mdash; The unary minus (&minus;) operator provides the unary minus (&minus;) operation recommended
  in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
&mdash; The scalbn and scalbln functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the scalb function
  recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
&mdash; The logb functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the logb function recommended in the
  Appendix to IEC 60559, but following the newer specifications in ANSI/IEEE 854.
&mdash; The nextafter and nexttoward functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the nextafter
  function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (but with a minor change to
        better handle signed zeros).
    &mdash; The isfinite macro in &lt;math.h&gt; provides the finite function recommended in
      the Appendix to IEC 60559.
    &mdash; The isnan macro in &lt;math.h&gt; provides the isnan function recommended in the
      Appendix to IEC 60559.
    &mdash; The signbit macro and the fpclassify macro in &lt;math.h&gt;, used in
      conjunction with the number classification macros (FP_NAN, FP_INFINITE,
      FP_NORMAL, FP_SUBNORMAL, FP_ZERO), provide the facility of the class
      function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (except that the classification
      macros defined in <a href='#7.12.3'>7.12.3</a> do not distinguish signaling from quiet NaNs).

<h3>F.4 [Floating to integer conversion]</h3>
<a name='F.4p1'></a>
<pre>1   If the integer type is _Bool, <a href='#6.3.1.2'>6.3.1.2</a> applies and no floating-point exceptions are raised
    (even for NaN). Otherwise, if the floating value is infinite or NaN or if the integral part
    of the floating value exceeds the range of the integer type, then the &lsquo;&lsquo;invalid&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-
    point exception is raised and the resulting value is unspecified. Otherwise, the resulting
    value is determined by <a href='#6.3.1.4'>6.3.1.4</a>. Conversion of an integral floating value that does not
    exceed the range of the integer type raises no floating-point exceptions; whether
    conversion of a non-integral floating value raises the &lsquo;&lsquo;inexact&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-point exception is
    unspecified.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.360'><sup>[360]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.360'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 360)</b> ANSI/IEEE 854, but not IEC 60559 (ANSI/IEEE 754), directly specifies that floating-to-integer
         conversions raise the &lsquo;&lsquo;inexact&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-point exception for non-integer in-range values. In those
         cases where it matters, library functions can be used to effect such conversions with or without raising
         the &lsquo;&lsquo;inexact&rsquo;&rsquo; floating-point exception. See rint, lrint, llrint, and nearbyint in

<h3>F.5 [Binary-decimal conversion]</h3>
<a name='F.5p1'></a>
<pre>1   Conversion from the widest supported IEC 60559 format to decimal with
    DECIMAL_DIG digits and back is the identity function.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.361'><sup>[361]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.361'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 361)</b> If the minimum-width IEC 60559 extended format (64 bits of precision) is supported,
         DECIMAL_DIG shall be at least 21. If IEC 60559 double (53 bits of precision) is the widest
         IEC 60559 format supported, then DECIMAL_DIG shall be at least 17. (By contrast, LDBL_DIG and
         DBL_DIG are 18 and 15, respectively, for these formats.)
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='F.5p2'></a>
<pre>2   Conversions involving IEC 60559 formats follow all pertinent recommended practice. In
    particular, conversion between any supported IEC 60559 format and decimal with
    DECIMAL_DIG or fewer significant digits is correctly rounded (honoring the current
    rounding mode), which assures that conversion from the widest supported IEC 60559
    format to decimal with DECIMAL_DIG digits and back is the identity function.
</pre>
<a name='F.5p3'></a>
<pre>3   Functions such as strtod that convert character sequences to floating types honor the
    rounding direction. Hence, if the rounding direction might be upward or downward, the
    implementation cannot convert a minus-signed sequence by negating the converted
    unsigned sequence.

<h3>F.6 [The return statement]</h3>
<pre>If the return expression is evaluated in a floating-point format different from the return
    type, the expression is converted as if by assignment<a href='#FOOTNOTE.362'><sup>[362]</sup></a> to the return type of the function

<pre>1   A contracted expression is correctly rounded (once) and treats infinities, NaNs, signed
    zeros, subnormals, and the rounding directions in a manner consistent with the basic
    arithmetic operations covered by IEC 60559.

<h3>F.8 [Floating-point environment]</h3>
<a name='F.8p1'></a>
<pre>1   The floating-point environment defined in &lt;fenv.h&gt; includes the IEC 60559 floating-
    point exception status flags and directed-rounding control modes. It includes also
    IEC 60559 dynamic rounding precision and trap enablement modes, if the
    implementation supports them.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.363'><sup>[363]</sup></a>

<a name='F.8.1'></a>
<hr>
<h3>F.8.1 [Environment management]</h3>
<a name='F.8.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   IEC 60559 requires that floating-point operations implicitly raise floating-point exception
    status flags, and that rounding control modes can be set explicitly to affect result values of
    floating-point operations. When the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma (defined in
    &lt;fenv.h&gt;) is &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;, these changes to the floating-point state are treated as side effects
    which respect sequence points.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.364'><sup>[364]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.364'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 364)</b> If the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma is &lsquo;&lsquo;off&rsquo;&rsquo;, the implementation is free to assume the floating-
         point control modes will be the default ones and the floating-point status flags will not be tested,
         which allows certain optimizations (see <a href='#F.9'>F.9</a>).

<h3>F.8.2 [Translation]</h3>
<a name='F.8.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   During translation the IEC 60559 default modes are in effect:
    &mdash; The rounding direction mode is rounding to nearest.
    &mdash; The rounding precision mode (if supported) is set so that results are not shortened.
    &mdash; Trapping or stopping (if supported) is disabled on all floating-point exceptions.
    Recommended practice
</pre>
<a name='F.8.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   The implementation should produce a diagnostic message for each translation-time
    floating-point exception, other than &lsquo;&lsquo;inexact&rsquo;&rsquo;;<a href='#FOOTNOTE.365'><sup>[365]</sup></a> the implementation should then
    proceed with the translation of the program.
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.365'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 365)</b> As floating constants are converted to appropriate internal representations at translation time, their
         conversion is subject to default rounding modes and raises no execution-time floating-point exceptions
         (even where the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;). Library functions, for example
         strtod, provide execution-time conversion of numeric strings.

    &mdash; The rounding direction mode is rounding to nearest.

<h3>F.8.4 [Constant expressions]</h3>
<a name='F.8.4p1'></a>
<pre>1   An arithmetic constant expression of floating type, other than one in an initializer for an
    object that has static or thread storage duration, is evaluated (as if) during execution; thus,
    it is affected by any operative floating-point control modes and raises floating-point
    exceptions as required by IEC 60559 (provided the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma

<pre><i><b>Footnote 366)</b> Where the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma is &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;, results of inexact expressions like 1.0/3.0
         are affected by rounding modes set at execution time, and expressions such as 0.0/0.0 and
         1.0/0.0 generate execution-time floating-point exceptions. The programmer can achieve the
         efficiency of translation-time evaluation through static initialization, such as

<a name='F.8.4p3'></a>
<pre>3   For the static initialization, the division is done at translation time, raising no (execution-time) floating-

<h3>F.8.5 [Initialization]</h3>
<a name='F.8.5p1'></a>
<pre>1   All computation for automatic initialization is done (as if) at execution time; thus, it is
    affected by any operative modes and raises floating-point exceptions as required by
    IEC 60559 (provided the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma is &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;). All computation
    for initialization of objects that have static or thread storage duration is done (as if) at
    translation time.

</pre>
<a name='F.8.5p3'></a>
<pre>3   The static initialization of v raises no (execution-time) floating-point exceptions because its computation is
    done at translation time. The automatic initialization of u and w require an execution-time conversion to
    float of the wider value <a href='#1.'>1.</a>1e75, which raises floating-point exceptions. The automatic initializations
    of x and y entail execution-time conversion; however, in some expression evaluation methods, the
    conversions is not to a narrower format, in which case no floating-point exception is raised.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.367'><sup>[367]</sup></a> The
    automatic initialization of z entails execution-time conversion, but not to a narrower format, so no floating-
    point exception is raised. Note that the conversions of the floating constants <a href='#1.'>1.</a>1e75 and <a href='#1.'>1.</a>1e75f to

<h3>F.8.6 [Changing the environment]</h3>

<h3>F.9 [Optimization]</h3>

<hr>
<h3>F.9.1 [Global transformations]</h3>
<a name='F.9.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   Floating-point arithmetic operations and external function calls may entail side effects
    which optimization shall honor, at least where the state of the FENV_ACCESS pragma is
    &lsquo;&lsquo;on&rsquo;&rsquo;. The flags and modes in the floating-point environment may be regarded as global
    variables; floating-point operations (+, *, etc.) implicitly read the modes and write the
    flags.
</pre>
<a name='F.9.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   Concern about side effects may inhibit code motion and removal of seemingly useless
    code. For example, in
             #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;
             #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
             void f(double x)

                  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) x + 1;
                  /* ... */
             }
    x + 1 might raise floating-point exceptions, so cannot be removed. And since the loop
    body might not execute (maybe 0 &ge; n), x + 1 cannot be moved out of the loop. (Of
    course these optimizations are valid if the implementation can rule out the nettlesome
    cases.)
</pre>
<a name='F.9.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   This specification does not require support for trap handlers that maintain information
    about the order or count of floating-point exceptions. Therefore, between function calls,
    floating-point exceptions need not be precise: the actual order and number of occurrences
    of floating-point exceptions (&gt; 1) may vary from what the source code expresses. Thus,
    the preceding loop could be treated as
            if (0 &lt; n) x + 1;

<a name='G.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   There are three imaginary types, designated as float _Imaginary, double

    standard for language-independent arithmetic (LIA&minus;1). LIA&minus;1 is more general than
    IEC 60559 (annex F) in that it covers integer and diverse floating-point arithmetics.

<h3>H.2 [Types]</h3>
<a name='H.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The relevant C arithmetic types meet the requirements of LIA&minus;1 types if an

<h3>H.2.1 [Boolean type]</h3>

<h3>H.2.2 [Integer types]</h3>
<a name='H.2.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   The signed C integer types int, long int, long long int, and the corresponding
    unsigned types are compatible with LIA&minus;1. If an implementation adds support for the
    LIA&minus;1 exceptional values &lsquo;&lsquo;integer_overflow&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;undefined&rsquo;&rsquo;, then those types are
    LIA&minus;1 conformant types. C&rsquo;s unsigned integer types are &lsquo;&lsquo;modulo&rsquo;&rsquo; in the LIA&minus;1 sense
    in that overflows or out-of-bounds results silently wrap. An implementation that defines
    signed integer types as also being modulo need not detect integer overflow, in which case,
    only integer divide-by-zero need be detected.
</pre>
<a name='H.2.2p2'></a>

<h3>H.2.3.3 [Rounding styles]</h3>
<a name='H.2.3.3p1'></a>
<pre>1   The C Standard requires all floating types to use the same radix and rounding style, so
    that only one identifier for each is provided to map to LIA&minus;1.
</pre>
<a name='H.2.3.3p2'></a>
<pre>2   The FLT_ROUNDS parameter can be used to indicate the LIA&minus;1 rounding styles:
    truncate       FLT_ROUNDS == 0
    nearest       FLT_ROUNDS == 1
    other         FLT_ROUNDS != 0 &amp;&amp; FLT_ROUNDS != 1
    provided that an implementation extends FLT_ROUNDS to cover the rounding style used
    in all relevant LIA&minus;1 operations, not just addition as in C.

<h3>H.2.4 [Type conversions]</h3>
<a name='H.2.4p1'></a>
<pre>1   The LIA&minus;1 type conversions are the following type casts:
    cvtI&rsquo; &rarr; I     (int)i, (long int)i, (long long int)i,
                  (unsigned int)i, (unsigned long int)i,
                  (unsigned long long int)i
    cvtF &rarr; I      (int)x, (long int)x, (long long int)x,
                  (unsigned int)x, (unsigned long int)x,
                  (unsigned long long int)x
    cvtI &rarr; F      (float)i, (double)i, (long double)i
    cvtF&rsquo; &rarr; F     (float)x, (double)x, (long double)x
</pre>
<a name='H.2.4p2'></a>
<pre>2   In the above conversions from floating to integer, the use of (cast)x can be replaced with
    (cast)round(x), (cast)rint(x), (cast)nearbyint(x), (cast)trunc(x),
    (cast)ceil(x), or (cast)floor(x). In addition, C&rsquo;s floating-point to integer
    conversion functions, lrint(), llrint(), lround(), and llround(), can be
    used. They all meet LIA&minus;1&rsquo;s requirements on floating to integer rounding for in-range
    values. For out-of-range values, the conversions shall silently wrap for the modulo types.
</pre>
<a name='H.2.4p3'></a>
<pre>3   The fmod() function is useful for doing silent wrapping to unsigned integer types, e.g.,
    fmod( fabs(rint(x)), 65536.0 ) or (0.0 &lt;= (y = fmod( rint(x),
    65536.0 )) ? y : 65536.0 + y) will compute an integer value in the range 0.0
    to 65535.0 which can then be cast to unsigned short int. But, the
    remainder() function is not useful for doing silent wrapping to signed integer types,
    e.g., remainder( rint(x), 65536.0 ) will compute an integer value in the
    range &minus;32767.0 to +32768.0 which is not, in general, in the range of signed short
    int.
</pre>
<a name='H.2.4p4'></a>
<pre>4   C&rsquo;s conversions (casts) from floating-point to floating-point can meet LIA&minus;1
    requirements if an implementation uses round-to-nearest (IEC 60559 default).
</pre>
<a name='H.2.4p5'></a>
<pre>5   C&rsquo;s conversions (casts) from integer to floating-point can meet LIA&minus;1 requirements if an
    implementation uses round-to-nearest.

<h3>H.3 [Notification]</h3>
<a name='H.3p1'></a>
<pre>1   Notification is the process by which a user or program is informed that an exceptional
    arithmetic operation has occurred. C&rsquo;s operations are compatible with LIA&minus;1 in that C
    allows an implementation to cause a notification to occur when any arithmetic operation
    returns an exceptional value as defined in LIA&minus;1 clause 5.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1'></a>
<hr>
<h3>H.3.1 [Notification alternatives]</h3>
<a name='H.3.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   LIA&minus;1 requires at least the following two alternatives for handling of notifications:
    setting indicators or trap-and-terminate. LIA&minus;1 allows a third alternative: trap-and-
    resume.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   An implementation need only support a given notification alternative for the entire
    program. An implementation may support the ability to switch between notification
    alternatives during execution, but is not required to do so. An implementation can
    provide separate selection for each kind of notification, but this is not required.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   C allows an implementation to provide notification. C&rsquo;s SIGFPE (for traps) and
    FE_INVALID, FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_UNDERFLOW (for indicators)
    can provide LIA&minus;1 notification.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   C&rsquo;s signal handlers are compatible with LIA&minus;1. Default handling of SIGFPE can
    provide trap-and-terminate behavior, except for those LIA&minus;1 operations implemented by
    math library function calls. User-provided signal handlers for SIGFPE allow for trap-
    and-resume behavior with the same constraint.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.1'></a>

<h3>H.3.1.1 [Indicators]</h3>
<a name='H.3.1.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   C&rsquo;s &lt;fenv.h&gt; status flags are compatible with the LIA&minus;1 indicators.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   The following mapping is for floating-point types:
    undefined                FE_INVALID, FE_DIVBYZERO
    floating_overflow        FE_OVERFLOW
    underflow                FE_UNDERFLOW
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   The floating-point indicator interrogation and manipulation operations are:
    set_indicators           feraiseexcept(i)
    clear_indicators         feclearexcept(i)
    test_indicators          fetestexcept(i)
    current_indicators       fetestexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT)
    where i is an expression of type int representing a subset of the LIA&minus;1 indicators.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   C allows an implementation to provide the following LIA&minus;1 required behavior: at
    and &lsquo;&lsquo;hard to ignore&rsquo;&rsquo; message (see LIA&minus;1 subclause 6.1.2)
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   LIA&minus;1 does not make the distinction between floating-point and integer for &lsquo;&lsquo;undefined&rsquo;&rsquo;.
    This documentation makes that distinction because &lt;fenv.h&gt; covers only the floating-
    point indicators.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.2'></a>
<hr>
<h3>H.3.1.2 [Traps]</h3>
<a name='H.3.1.2p1'></a>
<pre>1   C is compatible with LIA&minus;1&rsquo;s trap requirements for arithmetic operations, but not for
    math library functions (which are not permitted to invoke a user&rsquo;s signal handler for
    SIGFPE). An implementation can provide an alternative of notification through
    termination with a &lsquo;&lsquo;hard-to-ignore&rsquo;&rsquo; message (see LIA&minus;1 subclause 6.1.3).
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.2p2'></a>
<pre>2   LIA&minus;1 does not require that traps be precise.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.2p3'></a>
<pre>3   C does require that SIGFPE be the signal corresponding to LIA&minus;1 arithmetic exceptions,
    if there is any signal raised for them.
</pre>
<a name='H.3.1.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   C supports signal handlers for SIGFPE and allows trapping of LIA&minus;1 arithmetic
    exceptions. When LIA&minus;1 arithmetic exceptions do trap, C&rsquo;s signal-handler mechanism
    allows trap-and-terminate (either default implementation behavior or user replacement for
    it) or trap-and-resume, at the programmer&rsquo;s option.

  specified type that is not compatible with the promoted type of the actual next
  argument, with certain exceptions (<a href='#7.16.1.1'>7.16.1.1</a>).
&mdash; The va_copy or va_start macro is called to initialize a va_list that was

  va_end macro for the same va_list (<a href='#7.16.1.2'>7.16.1.2</a>, <a href='#7.16.1.4'>7.16.1.4</a>).
&mdash; The parameter parmN of a va_start macro is declared with the register
  storage class, with a function or array type, or with a type that is not compatible with
  the type that results after application of the default argument promotions (<a href='#7.16.1.4'>7.16.1.4</a>).
&mdash; The member designator parameter of an offsetof macro is an invalid right
  operand of the . operator for the type parameter, or designates a bit-field (<a href='#7.19'>7.19</a>).

<h3>K.1 [Background]</h3>
<a name='K.1p1'></a>
<pre>1   Traditionally, the C Library has contained many functions that trust the programmer to
    provide output character arrays big enough to hold the result being produced. Not only
    do these functions not check that the arrays are big enough, they frequently lack the
    information needed to perform such checks. While it is possible to write safe, robust, and
    error-free code using the existing library, the library tends to promote programming styles
    that lead to mysterious failures if a result is too big for the provided array.
</pre>
<a name='K.1p2'></a>
<pre>2   A common programming style is to declare character arrays large enough to handle most
    practical cases. However, if these arrays are not large enough to handle the resulting
    strings, data can be written past the end of the array overwriting other data and program
    structures. The program never gets any indication that a problem exists, and so never has
    a chance to recover or to fail gracefully.
</pre>
<a name='K.1p3'></a>
<pre>3   Worse, this style of programming has compromised the security of computers and
    networks. Buffer overflows can often be exploited to run arbitrary code with the
    permissions of the vulnerable (defective) program.
</pre>
<a name='K.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   If the programmer writes runtime checks to verify lengths before calling library
    functions, then those runtime checks frequently duplicate work done inside the library
    functions, which discover string lengths as a side effect of doing their job.
</pre>
<a name='K.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   This annex provides alternative library functions that promote safer, more secure
    programming. The alternative functions verify that output buffers are large enough for
    the intended result and return a failure indicator if they are not. Data is never written past
    the end of an array. All string results are null terminated.
</pre>
<a name='K.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   This annex also addresses another problem that complicates writing robust code:
    functions that are not reentrant because they return pointers to static objects owned by the
    function. Such functions can be troublesome since a previously returned result can
    change if the function is called again, perhaps by another thread.

         runtime-constraint violation by calling the runtime-constraint handler. This license comes directly
         from the definition of undefined behavior.
</i></pre>
</a>
<a name='K.3.1.4p2'></a>
<pre>2   Implementations shall verify that the runtime-constraints for a function are not violated
    by the program. If a runtime-constraint is violated, the implementation shall call the
    currently registered runtime-constraint handler (see set_constraint_handler_s
    in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;). Multiple runtime-constraint violations in the same call to a library
    function result in only one call to the runtime-constraint handler. It is unspecified which
    one of the multiple runtime-constraint violations cause the handler to be called.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.1.4p3'></a>
<pre>3   If the runtime-constraints section for a function states an action to be performed when a
    runtime-constraint violation occurs, the function shall perform the action before calling
    the runtime-constraint handler. If the runtime-constraints section lists actions that are
    prohibited when a runtime-constraint violation occurs, then such actions are prohibited to
    the function both before calling the handler and after the handler returns.

<pre>3   Extremely large object sizes are frequently a sign that an object&rsquo;s size was calculated

</pre>
<a name='K.3.4p4'></a>
<pre>4   For those reasons, it is sometimes beneficial to restrict the range of object sizes to detect
    programming errors. For implementations targeting machines with large address spaces,
    it is recommended that RSIZE_MAX be defined as the smaller of the size of the largest
    object supported or (SIZE_MAX &gt;&gt; 1), even if this limit is smaller than the size of
    some legitimate, but very large, objects. Implementations targeting machines with small
    address spaces may wish to define RSIZE_MAX as SIZE_MAX, which means that there
    is no object size that is considered a runtime-constraint violation.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.5.1.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   The tmpfile_s function creates a temporary binary file that is different from any other
    existing file and that will automatically be removed when it is closed or at program
    termination. If the program terminates abnormally, whether an open temporary file is
    removed is implementation-defined. The file is opened for update with &quot;wb+&quot; mode
    with the meaning that mode has in the fopen_s function (including the mode&rsquo;s effect
    on exclusive access and file permissions).
</pre>
<a name='K.3.5.1.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   If the file was created successfully, then the pointer to FILE pointed to by streamptr
    will be set to the pointer to the object controlling the opened file. Otherwise, the pointer
    to FILE pointed to by streamptr will be set to a null pointer.
    Recommended practice
    It should be possible to open at least TMP_MAX_S temporary files during the lifetime of
    the program (this limit may be shared with tmpnam_s) and there should be no limit on
    the number simultaneously open other than this limit and any limit on the number of open
    files (FOPEN_MAX).

         is ended, and before program termination. Implementations should take care in choosing the patterns

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.5.2.2p4'></a>
<pre>4   The freopen_s function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by

    argument has the same meaning as in the fopen_s function (including the mode&rsquo;s effect
    on exclusive access and file permissions).
</pre>

<pre>5   If filename is a null pointer, the freopen_s function attempts to change the mode of
    the stream to that specified by mode, as if the name of the file currently associated with
    the stream had been used. It is implementation-defined which changes of mode are
    permitted (if any), and under what circumstances.

<pre>3   If there is a runtime-constraint violation, the strtok_s function does not indirect

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.7.3.1p4'></a>
<pre>4   A sequence of calls to the strtok_s function breaks the string pointed to by s1 into a
    sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a character from the string pointed to
    by s2. The fourth argument points to a caller-provided char pointer into which the
    strtok_s function stores information necessary for it to continue scanning the same
    string.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.7.3.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   The first call in a sequence has a non-null first argument and s1max points to an object
    whose value is the number of elements in the character array pointed to by the first
    argument. The first call stores an initial value in the object pointed to by ptr and
    updates the value pointed to by s1max to reflect the number of elements that remain in
    relation to ptr. Subsequent calls in the sequence have a null first argument and the
    objects pointed to by s1max and ptr are required to have the values stored by the
    previous call in the sequence, which are then updated. The separator string pointed to by
    s2 may be different from call to call.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.7.3.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by s1 for the first character
    that is not contained in the current separator string pointed to by s2. If no such character
    is found, then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by s1 and the strtok_s
    function returns a null pointer. If such a character is found, it is the start of the first token.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.7.3.1p7'></a>
<pre>7    The strtok_s function then searches from there for the first character in s1 that is
     contained in the current separator string. If no such character is found, the current token
     extends to the end of the string pointed to by s1, and subsequent searches in the same
     string for a token return a null pointer. If such a character is found, it is overwritten by a
     null character, which terminates the current token.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.7.3.1p8'></a>
<pre>8    In all cases, the strtok_s function stores sufficient information in the pointer pointed
     to by ptr so that subsequent calls, with a null pointer for s1 and the unmodified pointer
     value for ptr, shall start searching just past the element overwritten by a null character
     (if any).

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.1.5p4'></a>
<pre>4   The swscanf_s function is equivalent to fwscanf_s, except that the argument s
    specifies a wide string from which the input is to be obtained, rather than from a stream.
    Reaching the end of the wide string is equivalent to encountering end-of-file for the
    fwscanf_s function.
    Returns
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.1.5p5'></a>
<pre>5   The swscanf_s function returns the value of the macro EOF if an input failure occurs
    before any conversion or if there is a runtime-constraint violation. Otherwise, the
    swscanf_s function returns the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer
    than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early matching failure.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.3.1.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   If s is a null pointer, the wcrtomb_s function is equivalent to the call

    where retval and buf are internal variables of the appropriate types, and the size of
    buf is greater than MB_CUR_MAX.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.3.1.1p6'></a>
<pre>6   If s is not a null pointer, the wcrtomb_s function determines the number of bytes
    needed to represent the multibyte character that corresponds to the wide character given
    by wc (including any shift sequences), and stores the multibyte character representation
    in the array whose first element is pointed to by s. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes are
    stored. If wc is a null wide character, a null byte is stored, preceded by any shift
    sequence needed to restore the initial shift state; the resulting state described is the initial
    conversion state.
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.3.1.1p7'></a>
<pre>7   If wc does not correspond to a valid multibyte character, an encoding error occurs: the
    wcrtomb_s function stores the value (size_t)(-1) into *retval and the
    conversion state is unspecified. Otherwise, the wcrtomb_s function stores into
    *retval the number of bytes (including any shift sequences) stored in the array pointed
    to by s.

    Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.3.2.1p5'></a>
<pre>5   The mbsrtowcs_s function converts a sequence of multibyte characters that begins in
    the conversion state described by the object pointed to by ps, from the array indirectly
    pointed to by src into a sequence of corresponding wide characters. If dst is not a null
    pointer, the converted characters are stored into the array pointed to by dst. Conversion
    continues up to and including a terminating null character, which is also stored.
    Conversion stops earlier in two cases: when a sequence of bytes is encountered that does
    not form a valid multibyte character, or (if dst is not a null pointer) when len wide
     characters have been stored into the array pointed to by dst.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.453'><sup>[453]</sup></a> If dst is not a null
     pointer and no null wide character was stored into the array pointed to by dst, then
     dst[len] is set to the null wide character. Each conversion takes place as if by a call
     to the mbrtowc function.

     Description
</pre>
<a name='K.3.9.3.2.1p14'></a>
<pre>14   The wcsrtombs_s function converts a sequence of wide characters from the array
     indirectly pointed to by src into a sequence of corresponding multibyte characters that
     begins in the conversion state described by the object pointed to by ps. If dst is not a
     null pointer, the converted characters are then stored into the array pointed to by dst.
     Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null wide character, which is also
     stored. Conversion stops earlier in two cases:
     &mdash; when a wide character is reached that does not correspond to a valid multibyte
       character;
     &mdash; (if dst is not a null pointer) when the next multibyte character would exceed the
         limit of n total bytes to be stored into the array pointed to by dst. If the wide
         character being converted is the null wide character, then n is the lesser of len or
         dstmax. Otherwise, n is the lesser of len or dstmax-1.
     If the conversion stops without converting a null wide character and dst is not a null
     pointer, then a null character is stored into the array pointed to by dst immediately
     following any multibyte characters already stored. Each conversion takes place as if by a
     call to the wcrtomb function.<a href='#FOOTNOTE.455'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
</pre>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.455'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 455)</b> If conversion stops because a terminating null wide character has been reached, the bytes stored
